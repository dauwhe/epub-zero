         </p><p id="ezra-1-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
         </p><p id="ezra-1-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
         </p><p id="ezra-1-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
         </p><p id="ezra-1-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

         </p><p id="ezra-2-59"><span class="num-verse-rw">59</span> And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:

         </p><p id="ezra-2-62"><span class="num-verse-rw">62</span> These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
         </p><p id="ezra-2-63"><span class="num-verse-rw">63</span> And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
         </p><p id="ezra-2-64"><span class="num-verse-rw">64</span> The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,

         </p><p id="ezra-2-68"><span class="num-verse-rw">68</span> And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:
         </p><p id="ezra-2-69"><span class="num-verse-rw">69</span> They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
         </p><p id="ezra-2-70"><span class="num-verse-rw">70</span> So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
         </p><h2 id="ezra-3">Chapter 3</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="ezra-3-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
         </p><p id="ezra-3-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
         </p><p id="ezra-3-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
         </p><p id="ezra-3-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
         </p><h2 id="ezra-4">Chapter 4</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="ezra-4-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;
         </p><p id="ezra-4-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
         </p><p id="ezra-4-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
         </p><p id="ezra-4-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
         </p><p id="ezra-4-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
         </p><p id="ezra-4-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.
         </p><p id="ezra-4-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?

         </p><p id="ezra-4-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
         </p><h2 id="ezra-5">Chapter 5</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="ezra-5-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?
         </p><p id="ezra-5-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?

         </p><p id="ezra-5-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
         </p><p id="ezra-5-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
         </p><p id="ezra-5-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.
         </p><p id="ezra-5-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.

         </p><h2 id="ezra-6">Chapter 6</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="ezra-6-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
         </p><p id="ezra-6-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:

         </p><p id="ezra-6-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

         </p><p id="ezra-6-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:

         </p><p id="ezra-6-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.

         </p><p id="ezra-6-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,

         </p><p id="ezra-8-35"><span class="num-verse-rw">35</span> Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.
         </p><p id="ezra-8-36"><span class="num-verse-rw">36</span> And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
         </p><h2 id="ezra-9">Chapter 9</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="ezra-9-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,
         </p><p id="ezra-9-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
         </p><p id="ezra-9-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
         </p><p id="ezra-9-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;
         </p><p id="ezra-9-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
         </p><p id="ezra-9-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
         </p><h2 id="ezra-10">Chapter 10</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="ezra-10-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
         </p><p id="ezra-10-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.
         </p><p id="ezra-10-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
