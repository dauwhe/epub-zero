         </p><p id="romans-1-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
         </p><p id="romans-1-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
         </p><p id="romans-1-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
         </p><p id="romans-1-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
         </p><p id="romans-1-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
         </p><p id="romans-1-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
         </p><p id="romans-1-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
         </p><p id="romans-1-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
         </p><p id="romans-1-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
         </p><p id="romans-1-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
         </p><p id="romans-1-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
         </p><p id="romans-1-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
         </p><p id="romans-1-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
         </p><p id="romans-1-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
         </p><p id="romans-1-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
         </p><p id="romans-1-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
         </p><p id="romans-1-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
         </p><p id="romans-1-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
         </p><p id="romans-1-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
         </p><p id="romans-1-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
         </p><p id="romans-1-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
         </p><p id="romans-1-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
         </p><p id="romans-1-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
         </p><p id="romans-1-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
         </p><p id="romans-1-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
         </p><p id="romans-1-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
         </p><p id="romans-1-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
         </p><p id="romans-1-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
         </p><p id="romans-1-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
         </p><p id="romans-1-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
         </p><p id="romans-1-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
         </p><h2 id="romans-2">Chapter 2</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="romans-2-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
         </p><p id="romans-2-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
         </p><p id="romans-2-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
         </p><p id="romans-2-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
         </p><p id="romans-2-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
         </p><p id="romans-2-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
         </p><p id="romans-2-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
         </p><p id="romans-2-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
         </p><p id="romans-2-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
         </p><p id="romans-2-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
         </p><p id="romans-2-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> For there is no respect of persons with God.
         </p><p id="romans-2-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
         </p><p id="romans-2-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
         </p><p id="romans-2-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
         </p><p id="romans-2-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
         </p><p id="romans-2-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
         </p><p id="romans-2-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
         </p><p id="romans-2-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
         </p><p id="romans-2-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
         </p><p id="romans-2-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
         </p><p id="romans-2-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
         </p><p id="romans-2-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
         </p><p id="romans-2-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
         </p><p id="romans-2-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
         </p><p id="romans-2-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
         </p><p id="romans-2-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
         </p><p id="romans-2-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
         </p><p id="romans-2-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
         </p><p id="romans-2-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
         </p><h2 id="romans-3">Chapter 3</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="romans-3-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
         </p><p id="romans-3-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
         </p><p id="romans-3-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
         </p><p id="romans-3-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
         </p><p id="romans-3-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
         </p><p id="romans-3-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
         </p><p id="romans-3-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
         </p><p id="romans-3-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
         </p><p id="romans-3-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
         </p><p id="romans-3-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
         </p><p id="romans-3-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
         </p><p id="romans-3-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
         </p><p id="romans-3-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
         </p><p id="romans-3-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
         </p><p id="romans-3-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Their feet are swift to shed blood:
         </p><p id="romans-3-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Destruction and misery are in their ways:
         </p><p id="romans-3-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And the way of peace have they not known:
         </p><p id="romans-3-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes.
         </p><p id="romans-3-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
         </p><p id="romans-3-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
         </p><p id="romans-3-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
         </p><p id="romans-3-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
         </p><p id="romans-3-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
         </p><p id="romans-3-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
         </p><p id="romans-3-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
         </p><p id="romans-3-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
         </p><p id="romans-3-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
         </p><p id="romans-3-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
         </p><p id="romans-3-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
         </p><p id="romans-3-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
         </p><p id="romans-3-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
         </p><h2 id="romans-4">Chapter 4</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="romans-4-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
         </p><p id="romans-4-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.
         </p><p id="romans-4-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-4-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
         </p><p id="romans-4-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-4-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
         </p><p id="romans-4-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
         </p><p id="romans-4-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
         </p><p id="romans-4-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-4-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
         </p><p id="romans-4-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
         </p><p id="romans-4-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
         </p><p id="romans-4-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
         </p><p id="romans-4-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
         </p><p id="romans-4-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
         </p><p id="romans-4-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
         </p><p id="romans-4-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
         </p><p id="romans-4-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
         </p><p id="romans-4-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:
         </p><p id="romans-4-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
         </p><p id="romans-4-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
         </p><p id="romans-4-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-4-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
         </p><p id="romans-4-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
         </p><p id="romans-4-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
         </p><h2 id="romans-5">Chapter 5</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="romans-5-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
         </p><p id="romans-5-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
         </p><p id="romans-5-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
         </p><p id="romans-5-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
         </p><p id="romans-5-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
         </p><p id="romans-5-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
         </p><p id="romans-5-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
         </p><p id="romans-5-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
         </p><p id="romans-5-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
         </p><p id="romans-5-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
         </p><p id="romans-5-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
         </p><p id="romans-5-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
         </p><p id="romans-5-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
         </p><p id="romans-5-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
         </p><p id="romans-5-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
         </p><p id="romans-5-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.
         </p><p id="romans-5-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
         </p><p id="romans-5-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
         </p><p id="romans-5-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
         </p><p id="romans-5-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
         </p><p id="romans-5-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

         </p><p id="romans-6-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
         </p><p id="romans-6-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
         </p><p id="romans-6-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
         </p><p id="romans-6-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
         </p><p id="romans-6-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> For he that is dead is freed from sin.
         </p><p id="romans-6-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:

         </p><p id="romans-6-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

         </p><p id="romans-6-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.

         </p><p id="romans-6-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.

         </p><p id="romans-6-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-6-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.
         </p><p id="romans-6-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
         </p><p id="romans-6-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

         </p><p id="romans-7-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.
         </p><p id="romans-7-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
         </p><p id="romans-7-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
         </p><p id="romans-7-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
         </p><p id="romans-7-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

         </p><p id="romans-8-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
         </p><p id="romans-8-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
         </p><p id="romans-8-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
         </p><p id="romans-8-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
         </p><p id="romans-8-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
         </p><p id="romans-8-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
         </p><p id="romans-8-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
         </p><p id="romans-8-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-8-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
         </p><p id="romans-8-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
         </p><p id="romans-8-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
         </p><p id="romans-8-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
         </p><p id="romans-8-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
         </p><p id="romans-8-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
         </p><p id="romans-8-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
         </p><p id="romans-8-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
         </p><p id="romans-8-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
         </p><p id="romans-8-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,
         </p><p id="romans-8-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
         </p><p id="romans-8-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
         </p><p id="romans-8-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
         </p><p id="romans-8-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
         </p><p id="romans-8-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
         </p><p id="romans-8-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
         </p><p id="romans-8-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
         </p><p id="romans-8-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
         </p><p id="romans-8-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

         </p><p id="romans-8-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
         </p><p id="romans-8-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
         </p><p id="romans-8-33"><span class="num-verse-rw">33</span> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
         </p><p id="romans-8-34"><span class="num-verse-rw">34</span> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
         </p><p id="romans-8-35"><span class="num-verse-rw">35</span> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

         </p><p id="romans-9-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
         </p><p id="romans-9-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

         </p><h2 id="romans-10">Chapter 10</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="romans-10-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
         </p><p id="romans-10-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
         </p><p id="romans-10-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
         </p><p id="romans-10-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
         </p><p id="romans-10-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
         </p><p id="romans-10-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
         </p><p id="romans-10-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
         </p><p id="romans-10-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
         </p><p id="romans-10-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
         </p><p id="romans-10-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
         </p><p id="romans-10-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
         </p><p id="romans-10-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

         </p><p id="romans-10-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
         </p><p id="romans-10-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
         </p><p id="romans-10-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
         </p><p id="romans-10-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
         </p><p id="romans-10-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

         </p><p id="romans-11-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
         </p><p id="romans-11-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
         </p><p id="romans-11-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

         </p><p id="romans-11-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
         </p><p id="romans-11-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
         </p><p id="romans-11-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.
         </p><p id="romans-11-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

         </p><p id="romans-11-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
         </p><p id="romans-11-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
         </p><p id="romans-11-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

         </p><p id="romans-11-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:

         </p><p id="romans-11-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.

         </p><p id="romans-14-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
         </p><p id="romans-14-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
         </p><p id="romans-14-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
         </p><h2 id="romans-15">Chapter 15</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="romans-15-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
         </p><p id="romans-15-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.
         </p><p id="romans-15-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
         </p><p id="romans-15-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
         </p><p id="romans-15-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
         </p><p id="romans-15-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
         </p><p id="romans-15-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
         </p><p id="romans-15-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
         </p><p id="romans-15-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
         </p><p id="romans-15-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
         </p><p id="romans-15-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
         </p><p id="romans-15-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
         </p><p id="romans-15-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
         </p><p id="romans-15-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
         </p><p id="romans-15-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
         </p><p id="romans-15-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
         </p><p id="romans-15-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
         </p><p id="romans-15-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
         </p><p id="romans-15-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
         </p><p id="romans-15-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:
         </p><p id="romans-15-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
         </p><p id="romans-15-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
         </p><p id="romans-15-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
         </p><p id="romans-15-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
         </p><p id="romans-15-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
         </p><p id="romans-15-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="romans-15-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
         </p><p id="romans-15-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
         </p><p id="romans-15-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
         </p><p id="romans-15-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
         </p><p id="romans-15-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
         </p><p id="romans-15-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
         </p><p id="romans-15-33"><span class="num-verse-rw">33</span> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

         </p><p id="romans-16-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
