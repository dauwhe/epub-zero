         </p><p id="joshua-1-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
         </p><p id="joshua-1-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
         </p><p id="joshua-1-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;
         </p><p id="joshua-1-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
         </p><p id="joshua-1-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
         </p><h2 id="joshua-2">Chapter 2</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="joshua-2-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:
         </p><p id="joshua-2-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
         </p><p id="joshua-2-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:
         </p><p id="joshua-2-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
         </p><p id="joshua-2-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:
         </p><p id="joshua-2-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
         </p><h2 id="joshua-3">Chapter 3</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="joshua-3-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
         </p><p id="joshua-3-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
         </p><p id="joshua-3-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
         </p><p id="joshua-3-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
         </p><p id="joshua-3-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.
         </p><h2 id="joshua-4">Chapter 4</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="joshua-4-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
         </p><p id="joshua-4-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
         </p><p id="joshua-4-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
         </p><p id="joshua-4-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
         </p><p id="joshua-4-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
         </p><p id="joshua-4-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
         </p><p id="joshua-4-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
         </p><p id="joshua-4-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
         </p><p id="joshua-4-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
         </p><p id="joshua-4-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:
         </p><p id="joshua-4-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.
         </p><h2 id="joshua-5">Chapter 5</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="joshua-5-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
         </p><p id="joshua-5-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
         </p><p id="joshua-5-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?
         </p><p id="joshua-5-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
         </p><h2 id="joshua-6">Chapter 6</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="joshua-6-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
         </p><p id="joshua-6-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.

         </p><p id="joshua-7-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
         </p><p id="joshua-7-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
         </p><p id="joshua-7-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
         </p><p id="joshua-7-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
         </p><p id="joshua-7-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
         </p><p id="joshua-7-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
         </p><p id="joshua-7-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
         </p><p id="joshua-7-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
         </p><p id="joshua-7-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
         </p><h2 id="joshua-8">Chapter 8</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="joshua-8-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
         </p><p id="joshua-8-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
         </p><p id="joshua-8-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
         </p><p id="joshua-8-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
         </p><p id="joshua-8-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-33"><span class="num-verse-rw">33</span> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-34"><span class="num-verse-rw">34</span> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
         </p><p id="joshua-8-35"><span class="num-verse-rw">35</span> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

         </p><p id="joshua-10-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
         </p><p id="joshua-10-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.

         </p><p id="joshua-10-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
         </p><p id="joshua-10-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

         </p><p id="joshua-10-33"><span class="num-verse-rw">33</span> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-34"><span class="num-verse-rw">34</span> And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

         </p><p id="joshua-10-36"><span class="num-verse-rw">36</span> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
         </p><p id="joshua-10-37"><span class="num-verse-rw">37</span> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-38"><span class="num-verse-rw">38</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
         </p><p id="joshua-10-39"><span class="num-verse-rw">39</span> And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-40"><span class="num-verse-rw">40</span> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
         </p><p id="joshua-10-41"><span class="num-verse-rw">41</span> And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

         </p><p id="joshua-10-43"><span class="num-verse-rw">43</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

         </p><p id="joshua-11-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

         </p><p id="joshua-24-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
         </p><p id="joshua-24-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-32"><span class="num-verse-rw">32</span> And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
         </p><p id="joshua-24-33"><span class="num-verse-rw">33</span> And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.
