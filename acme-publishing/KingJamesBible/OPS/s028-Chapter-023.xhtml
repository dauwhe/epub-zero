         </p><p id="isaiah-1-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-28"><span class="num-verse-rw">28</span> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-30"><span class="num-verse-rw">30</span> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
         </p><p id="isaiah-1-31"><span class="num-verse-rw">31</span> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
         </p><h2 id="isaiah-2">Chapter 2</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="isaiah-2-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
         </p><p id="isaiah-2-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
         </p><h2 id="isaiah-3">Chapter 3</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="isaiah-3-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> The rings, and nose jewels,
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
         </p><p id="isaiah-3-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
         </p><h2 id="isaiah-4">Chapter 4</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="isaiah-4-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
         </p><p id="isaiah-4-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
         </p><p id="isaiah-4-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:
         </p><p id="isaiah-4-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
         </p><p id="isaiah-4-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.
         </p><p id="isaiah-4-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.

         </p><p id="isaiah-5-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

         </p><p id="isaiah-5-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

         </p><p id="isaiah-5-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.

         </p><p id="isaiah-5-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:

         </p><p id="isaiah-5-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
         </p><p id="isaiah-5-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

         </p><p id="isaiah-37-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
