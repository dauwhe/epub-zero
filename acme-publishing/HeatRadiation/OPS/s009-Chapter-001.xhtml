         </div>

         <p id="p33"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">1</span>. Heat may be propagated in a stationary medium in two entirely different ways, namely, by conduction and by radiation. Conduction of heat depends on the temperature of the medium in which it takes place, or more strictly speaking, on the non-uniform distribution of the temperature in space, as measured by the temperature gradient. In a region where the temperature of the medium is the same at all points there is no trace of heat conduction.
         </p>

         <p id="p34">Radiation of heat, however, is in itself entirely independent of the temperature of the medium through which it passes. It is possible, for example, to concentrate the solar rays at a focus by passing them through a converging lens of ice, the latter remaining at a constant temperature of&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-4"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-4-eq"><msup><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>&#8728;</mo></mrow></msup></math></span>, and so to ignite an inflammable body. Generally speaking, radiation is a far more complicated phenomenon than conduction of heat. The reason for this is that the state of the radiation at a given instant and at a given point of the medium cannot be represented, as can the flow of heat by conduction, by a single vector (that is, a single directed quantity). All heat rays which at a given instant pass through the same point of the medium are perfectly independent of one another, and in order to specify completely the state of the radiation the intensity of radiation must be known in all the directions, infinite in number, which pass through the point in question; for this purpose two opposite directions must be considered as distinct, because the radiation in one of them is quite independent of the radiation in the other. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p35"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">2.</span> Putting aside for the present any special theory of heat radiation, we shall state for our further use a law supported by a large number of experimental facts. This law is that, so far as their physical properties are concerned, heat rays are identical with light rays of the same wave length. The term &#8220;heat radiation,&#8221; then, will be applied to all physical phenomena of the same nature as light rays. Every light ray is simultaneously a heat ray. We shall also, for the sake of brevity, occasionally speak of the &#8220;color&#8221; of a heat ray in order to denote its wave length or period. As a further consequence of this law we shall apply to the radiation of heat all the well-known laws of experimental optics, especially those of reflection and refraction, as well as those relating to the propagation of light. Only the phenomena of diffraction, so far at least as they take place in space of considerable dimensions, we shall exclude on account of their rather complicated nature. We are therefore obliged to introduce right at the start a certain restriction with respect to the size of the parts of space to be considered. Throughout the following discussion it will be assumed that the linear dimensions of all parts of space considered, as well as the radii of curvature of all surfaces under consideration, are large compared with the wave lengths of the rays considered. With this assumption we may, without appreciable error, entirely neglect the influence of diffraction caused by the bounding surfaces, and everywhere apply the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction of light. To sum up: We distinguish once for all between two kinds of lengths of entirely different orders of magnitude&#8212;dimensions of bodies and wave lengths. Moreover, even the differentials of the former, <i>i.e.</i>, elements of length, area and volume, will be regarded as large compared with the corresponding powers of wave lengths. The greater, therefore, the wave length of the rays we wish to consider, the larger must be the parts of space considered. But, inasmuch as there is no other restriction on our choice of size of the parts of space to be considered, this assumption will not give rise to any particular difficulty. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p36"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">3.</span> Even more essential for the whole theory of heat radiation than the distinction between large and small lengths, is the distinction between long and short intervals of time. For the definition of intensity of a heat ray, as being the energy transmitted by the ray per unit time, implies the assumption that the unit of time chosen is large compared with the period of vibration corresponding to the color of the ray. If this were not so, obviously the value of the intensity of the radiation would, in general, depend upon the particular phase of vibration at which the measurement of the energy of the ray was begun, and the intensity of a ray of constant period and amplitude would not be independent of the initial phase, unless by chance the unit of time were an integral multiple of the period. To avoid this difficulty, we are obliged to postulate quite generally that the unit of time, or rather that element of time used in defining the intensity, even if it appear in the form of a differential, must be large compared with the period of all colors contained in the ray in question.
         </p>

         <p id="p37">The last statement leads to an important conclusion as to radiation of variable intensity. If, using an acoustic analogy, we speak of &#8220;beats&#8221; in the case of intensities undergoing periodic changes, the &#8220;unit&#8221; of time required for a definition of the instantaneous intensity of radiation must necessarily be small compared with the period of the beats. Now, since from the previous statement our unit must be large compared with a period of vibration, it follows that the period of the beats must be large compared with that of a vibration. Without this restriction it would be impossible to distinguish properly between &#8220;beats&#8221; and simple &#8220;vibrations.&#8221; Similarly, in the general case of an arbitrarily variable intensity of radiation, the vibrations must take place very rapidly as compared with the relatively slower changes in intensity. These statements imply, of course, a certain far-reaching restriction as to the generality of the radiation phenomena to be considered.</p>

         <p id="p38">It might be added that a very similar and equally essential restriction is made in the kinetic theory of gases by dividing the motions of a chemically simple gas into two classes: visible, coarse, or molar, and invisible, fine, or molecular. For, since the velocity of a single molecule is a perfectly unambiguous quantity, this distinction cannot be drawn unless the assumption be made that the velocity-components of the molecules contained in sufficiently small volumes have certain mean values, independent of the size of the volumes. This in general need not by any means be the case. If such a mean value, including the value zero, does not exist, the distinction between motion of the gas as a whole and random undirected heat motion cannot be made.</p>

         <p id="p39">Turning now to the investigation of the laws in accordance with which the phenomena of radiation take place in a medium supposed to be at rest, the problem may be approached in two ways: We must either select a certain point in space and investigate the different rays passing through this one point as time goes on, or we must select one distinct ray and inquire into its history, that is, into the way in which it was created, propagated, and finally destroyed. For the following discussion, it will be advisable to start with the second method of treatment and to consider first the three processes just mentioned. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p40"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">4.</span> <b>Emission.</b>&#8212;The creation of a heat ray is generally denoted by the word emission. According to the principle of the conservation of energy, emission always takes place at the expense of other forms of energy (heat,<span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-1" epub:type="noteref"><a href="#rw-num-note-1">1</a></span> chemical or electric energy,&#160;etc.)&#160;and hence it follows that only material particles, not geometrical volumes or surfaces, can emit heat rays. It is true that for the sake of brevity we frequently speak of the surface of a body as radiating heat to the surroundings, but this form of expression does not imply that the surface actually emits heat rays. Strictly speaking, the surface of a body never emits rays, but rather it allows part of the rays coming from the interior to pass through. The other part is reflected inward and according as the fraction transmitted is larger or smaller the surface seems to emit more or less intense radiations.
         </p>

         <p id="p41">We shall now consider the interior of an emitting substance assumed to be physically homogeneous, and in it we shall select any volume-element&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-5"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-5-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span> of not too small size. Then the energy which is emitted by radiation in unit time by all particles in this volume-element will be proportional to&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-6"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-6-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span>. Should we attempt a closer analysis of the process of emission and resolve it into its elements, we should undoubtedly meet very complicated conditions, for then it would be necessary to consider elements of space of such small size that it would no longer be admissible to think of the substance as homogeneous, and we would have to allow for the atomic constitution. Hence the finite quantity obtained by dividing the radiation emitted by a volume-element&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-7"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-7-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span> by this element&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-8"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-8-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span> is to be considered only as a certain mean value. Nevertheless, we shall as a rule be able to treat the phenomenon of emission as if all points of the volume-element&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-9"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-9-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span> took part in the emission in a uniform manner, thereby greatly simplifying our calculation. Every point of&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-10"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-10-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span> will then be the vertex of a pencil of rays diverging in all directions. Such a pencil coming from one single point of course does not represent a finite amount of energy, because a finite amount is emitted only by a finite though possibly small volume, not by a single point.
         </p>

         <p id="p42">We shall next assume our substance to be isotropic. Hence the radiation of the volume-element&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-11"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-11-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#964;</mi></math></span> is emitted uniformly in all directions of space. Draw a cone in an arbitrary direction, having any point of the radiating element as vertex, and describe around the vertex as center a sphere of unit radius. This sphere intersects the cone in what is known as the solid angle of the cone, and from the isotropy of the medium it follows that the radiation in any such conical element will be proportional to its solid angle. This holds for cones of any size. If we take the solid angle as infinitely small and of size&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-12"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-12-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#937;</mi></math></span> we may speak of the radiation emitted in a certain direction, but always in the sense that for the emission of a finite amount of energy an infinite number of directions are necessary and these form a finite solid angle. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p43"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">5.</span> The distribution of energy in the radiation is in general quite arbitrary; that is, the different colors of a certain radiation may have quite different intensities. The color of a ray in experimental physics is usually denoted by its wave length, because this quantity is measured directly. For the theoretical treatment, however, it is usually preferable to use the frequency&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-13"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-13-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span> instead, since the characteristic of color is not so much the wave length, which changes from one medium to another, as the frequency, which remains unchanged in a light or heat ray passing through stationary media. We shall, therefore, hereafter denote a certain color by the corresponding value of&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-14"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-14-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span>, and a certain interval of color by the limits of the interval <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-15"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-15-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span>&#160;and&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-16"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-16-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi></math></span>, where <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-17"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-17-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi><mo>&amp;gt;</mo><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span>. The radiation lying in a certain interval of color divided by the magnitude <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-18"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-18-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi><mo>&#8722;</mo><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span> of the interval, we shall call the mean radiation in the interval <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-19"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-19-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span>&#160;to&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-20"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-20-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi></math></span>. We shall then assume that if, keeping <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-21"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-21-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span> constant, we take the interval <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-22"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-22-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi><mo>&#8722;</mo><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span> sufficiently small and denote it by&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-23"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-23-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span> the value of the mean radiation approaches a definite limiting value, independent of the size of&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-24"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-24-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span>, and this we shall briefly call the &#8220;radiation of frequency&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-25"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-25-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span>.&#8221; To produce a finite intensity of radiation, the frequency interval, though perhaps small, must also be finite.
         </p>

         <p id="p44">We have finally to allow for the polarization of the emitted radiation. Since the medium was assumed to be isotropic the emitted rays are unpolarized. Hence every ray has just twice the intensity of one of its plane polarized components, which could, <i>e.g.</i>, be obtained by passing the ray through a <i>Nicol&#8217;s</i> prism. <b> </b>

         <p id="p50">We shall now introduce the further simplifying assumption that the physical and chemical condition of the emitting substance depends on but a single variable, namely, on its absolute temperature&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-53"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-53-eq"><mi>T</mi></math></span>. A necessary consequence of this is that the coefficient of emission&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-54"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-54-eq"><mi>&#949;</mi></math></span> depends, apart from the frequency&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-55"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-55-eq"><mi>&#957;</mi></math></span> and the nature of the medium, only on the temperature&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-56"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-56-eq"><mi>T</mi></math></span>. The last statement excludes from our consideration a number of radiation phenomena, such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, electrical and chemical luminosity, to which <i>E.&#160;Wiedemann</i> has given the common name &#8220;phenomena of luminescence.&#8221; We shall deal with pure &#8220;temperature radiation&#8221; exclusively.
         </p>

         <p id="p51">A special case of temperature radiation is the case of the chemical nature of the emitting substance being invariable. In this case the emission takes place entirely at the expense of the heat of the body. Nevertheless, it is possible, according to what has been said, to have temperature radiation while chemical changes are taking place, provided the chemical condition is completely determined by the temperature. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p52"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">8.</span> <b>Propagation.</b>&#8212;The propagation of the radiation in a medium assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic, and at rest takes place in straight lines and with the same velocity in all directions, diffraction phenomena being entirely excluded. Yet, in general, each ray suffers during its propagation a certain weakening, because a certain fraction of its energy is continuously deviated from its original direction and scattered in all directions. This phenomenon of &#8220;scattering,&#8221; which means neither a creation nor a destruction of radiant energy but simply a change in distribution, takes place, generally speaking, in all media differing from an absolute vacuum, even in substances which are perfectly pure chemically.<span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-2" epub:type="noteref"><a href="#rw-num-note-2">2</a></span> The cause of this is that no substance is homogeneous in the absolute sense of the word. The smallest elements of space always exhibit some discontinuities on account of their atomic structure. Small impurities, as, for instance, particles of dust, increase the influence of scattering without, however, appreciably affecting its general character. Hence, so-called &#8220;turbid&#8221; media, <i>i.e.</i>, such as contain foreign particles, may be quite properly regarded as optically homogeneous,<span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-3" epub:type="noteref"><a href="#rw-num-note-3">3</a></span> provided only that the linear dimensions of the foreign particles as well as the distances of neighboring particles are sufficiently small compared with the wave lengths of the rays considered. As regards optical phenomena, then, there is no fundamental distinction between chemically pure substances and the turbid media just described. No space is optically void in the absolute sense except a vacuum. Hence a chemically pure substance may be spoken of as a vacuum made turbid by the presence of molecules.
         </p>

         <p id="p53">A typical example of scattering is offered by the behavior of sunlight in the atmosphere. When, with a clear sky, the sun stands in the zenith, only about two-thirds of the direct radiation of the sun reaches the surface of the earth. The remainder is intercepted by the atmosphere, being partly absorbed and changed into heat of the air, partly, however, scattered and changed into diffuse skylight. This phenomenon is produced probably not so much by the particles suspended in the atmosphere as by the air molecules themselves.</p>

         <p id="p54">Whether the scattering depends on reflection, on diffraction, or on a resonance effect on the molecules or particles is a point that we may leave entirely aside.

         <p id="p57">The scattered radiation energy is propagated from the place where the scattering occurs in a way similar to that in which the emitted energy is propagated from the place of emission, since it travels in all directions in space. It does not, however, have the same intensity in all directions, and moreover is polarized in some special directions, depending to a large extent on the direction of the original ray. We need not, however, enter into any further discussion of these questions. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p58"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">9.</span> While the phenomenon of scattering means a continuous modification in the interior of the medium, a discontinuous change in both the direction and the intensity of a ray occurs when it reaches the boundary of a medium and meets the surface of a second medium. The latter, like the former, will be assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. In this case, the ray is in general partly reflected and partly transmitted. The reflection and refraction may be &#8220;regular,&#8221; there being a single reflected ray according to the simple law of reflection and a single transmitted ray, according to <i>Snell&#8217;s</i> law of refraction, or, they may be &#8220;diffuse,&#8221; which means that from the point of incidence on the surface the radiation spreads out into the two media with intensities that are different in different directions. We accordingly describe the surface of the second medium as &#8220;smooth&#8221; or &#8220;rough&#8221; respectively. Diffuse reflection occurring at a rough surface should be carefully distinguished from reflection at a smooth surface of a turbid medium. In both cases part of the incident ray goes back to the first medium as diffuse radiation. But in the first case the scattering occurs on the surface, in the second in more or less thick layers entirely inside of the second medium. <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p59"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">10.</span> When a smooth surface completely reflects all incident rays, as is approximately the case with many metallic surfaces, it is termed &#8220;reflecting.&#8221; When a rough surface reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions, it is called &#8220;white.&#8221; The other extreme, namely, complete transmission of all incident rays through the surface never occurs with smooth surfaces, at least if the two contiguous media are at all optically different. A rough surface having the property of completely transmitting the incident radiation is described as &#8220;black.&#8221;
         </p>

         <p id="p60">In addition to &#8220;black surfaces&#8221; the term &#8220;black body&#8221; is also used. According to <i>G.&#160;Kirchhoff </i><span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-5" epub:type="noteref"><a href="#rw-num-note-5">5</a></span> it denotes a body which has the property of allowing all incident rays to enter without surface reflection and not allowing them to leave again. Hence it is seen that a black body must satisfy three independent conditions. First, the body must have a black surface in order to allow the incident rays to enter without reflection. Since, in general, the properties of a surface depend on both of the bodies which are in contact, this condition shows that the property of blackness as applied to a body depends not only on the nature of the body but also on that of the contiguous medium. A body which is black relatively to air need not be so relatively to glass, and <i>vice versa</i>. Second, the black body must have a certain minimum thickness depending on its absorbing power, in order to insure that the rays after passing into the body shall not be able to leave it again at a different point of the surface. The more absorbing a body is, the smaller the value of this minimum thickness, while in the case of bodies with vanishingly small absorbing power only a layer of infinite thickness may be regarded as black. Third, the black body must have a vanishingly small coefficient of scattering <span class="ref-seetarget-rw">(Sec.&#160;8)</span>. Otherwise the rays received by it would be partly scattered in the interior and might leave again through the surface.<span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-6" epub:type="noteref"><a href="#rw-num-note-6">6</a></span> <b> </b>
         </p>

         <p id="p61"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">11.</span> All the distinctions and definitions mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs refer to rays of one definite color only. It might very well happen that, <i>e.g.</i>, a surface which is rough for a certain kind of rays must be regarded as smooth for a different kind of rays. It is readily seen that, in general, a surface shows decreasing degrees of roughness for increasing wave lengths. Now, since smooth non-reflecting surfaces do not exist <span class="ref-seetarget-rw">(Sec.&#160;10)</span>, it follows that all approximately black surfaces which may be realized in practice (lamp black, platinum black) show appreciable reflection for rays of sufficiently long wave lengths. <b> </b>

         <p id="p62"><span class="num-seetarget-rw">12.</span> <b>Absorption.</b>&#8212;Heat rays are destroyed by &#8220;absorption.&#8221; According to the principle of the conservation of energy the energy of heat radiation is thereby changed into other forms of energy (heat, chemical energy).

Hence there exists in nature no absolutely homogeneous or monochromatic radiation of light or heat. A finite amount of radiation contains always a finite although possibly very narrow range of the spectrum. This implies a fundamental difference from the corresponding phenomena of acoustics, where a finite intensity of sound may correspond to a single definite frequency. This difference is, among other things, the cause of the fact that the second law of thermodynamics has an important bearing on light and heat rays, but not on sound waves. This will be further discussed later on. <b> </b>

Similarly the pencil of rays may be thought of as consisting of the cones which, emanating from all points of&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-219"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-219-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#963;</mi></math></span>, converge in one point of&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-220"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-220-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#963;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi></math></span> respectively as a vertex. If we now imagine the whole pencil of rays to be cut by a plane at any arbitrary distance from the elements <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-221"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-221-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#963;</mi></math></span> and&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-222"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-222-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#963;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi></math></span> and lying either between them or outside, then the cross-sections of any two point pencils on this plane will not be identical, not even approximately. In general they will partly overlap and partly lie outside of each other, the amount of overlapping being different for different intersecting planes. Hence it follows that there is no definite cross-section of the pencil of rays so far as the uniformity of radiation is concerned. If, however, the intersecting plane coincides with either <span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-223"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-223-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#963;</mi></math></span> or&#160;<span class="mathml-rw" id="mathi-224"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mathi-224-eq"><mi>d</mi><mi>&#963;</mi><mi>&#8242;</mi></math></span>, then the pencil has a definite cross-section. Thus these two planes show an exceptional property. We shall call them the two &#8220;focal planes&#8221; of the pencil.
         </p>

         <p id="p111">In the special case already mentioned above, namely, when one of the two focal planes is infinitely small compared with the other, the whole pencil of rays shows the character of a point pencil inasmuch as its form is approximately that of a cone having its vertex in that focal plane which is small compared with the other. In that case the &#8220;cross-section&#8221; of the whole pencil at a definite point has a definite meaning. Such a pencil of rays, which is similar to a cone, we shall call an elementary pencil, and the small focal plane we shall call the first focal plane of the elementary pencil. The radiation may be either converging toward the first focal plane or diverging from the first focal plane. All the pencils of rays passing through a medium may be considered as consisting of such elementary pencils, and hence we may base our future considerations on elementary pencils only, which is a great convenience, owing to their simple nature.</p>
