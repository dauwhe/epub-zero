<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
</div>


<p>The biographer is now faced with
a difficulty which it is better perhaps to confess than to gloss
over. Up to this point in telling the story of Orlando’s life,
documents, both private and historical, have made it possible to
fulfil the first duty of a biographer, which is to plod, without
looking to right or left, in the indelible footprints of truth;
unenticed by flowers; regardless of shade; on and on methodically
till we fall plump into the grave and write finis on the tombstone
above our heads. But now we come to an episode which lies right
across our path, so that there is no ignoring it. Yet it is dark,
mysterious, and undocumented; so that there is no explaining it.
Volumes might be written in interpretation of it; whole religious
systems founded upon the signification of it. Our simple duty is to
state the facts as far as they are known, and so let the reader
make of them what he may.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p>In the summer of that disastrous winter which saw the frost, the
flood, the deaths of many thousands, and the complete downfall of
Orlando’s hopes — for he was exiled from Court; in deep disgrace
with the most powerful nobles of his time; the Irish house of
Desmond was justly enraged; the King had already trouble enough
with the Irish not to relish this further addition — in that summer
Orlando retired to his great house in the country and there lived
in complete solitude. One June morning — it was Saturday the 18th —
he failed to rise at his usual hour, and when his groom went to
call him he was found fast asleep. Nor could he be awakened. He lay
as if in a trance, without perceptible breathing; and though dogs
were set to bark under his window; cymbals, drums, bones beaten
perpetually in his room; a gorse bush put under his pillow; and
mustard plasters applied to his feet, still he did not wake, take
food, or show any sign of life for seven whole days. On the seventh
day he woke at his usual time (a quarter before eight, precisely)
and turned the whole posse of caterwauling wives and village
soothsayers out of his room, which was natural enough; but what was
strange was that he showed no consciousness of any such trance, but
dressed himself and sent for his horse as if he had woken from a
single night’s slumber. Yet some change, it was suspected, must
have taken place in the chambers of his brain, for though he was
perfectly rational and seemed graver and more sedate in his ways
than before, he appeared to have an imperfect recollection of his
past life. He would listen when people spoke of the great frost or
the skating or the carnival, but he never gave any sign, except by
passing his hand across his brow as if to wipe away some cloud, of
having witnessed them himself. When the events of the past six
months were discussed, he seemed not so much distressed as puzzled,
as if he were troubled by confused memories of some time long gone
or were trying to recall stories told him by another. It was
observed that if Russia was mentioned or Princesses or ships, he
would fall into a gloom of an uneasy kind and get up and look out
of the window or call one of the dogs to him, or take a knife and
carve a piece of cedar wood. But the doctors were hardly wiser then
than they are now, and after prescribing rest and exercise,
starvation and nourishment, society and solitude, that he should
lie in bed all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner,
together with the usual sedatives and irritants, diversified, as
the fancy took them, with possets of newt’s slobber on rising, and
draughts of peacock’s gall on going to bed, they left him to
himself, and gave it as their opinion that he had been asleep for a
week.</p>
<p>But if sleep it was, of what nature, we can scarcely refrain
from asking, are such sleeps as these? Are they remedial measures —
trances in which the most galling memories, events that seem likely
to cripple life for ever, are brushed with a dark wing which rubs
their harshness off and gilds them, even the ugliest and basest,
with a lustre, an incandescence? Has the finger of death to be laid
on the tumult of life from time to time lest it rend us asunder?
Are we so made that we have to take death in small doses daily or
we could not go on with the business of living? And then what
strange powers are these that penetrate our most secret ways and
change our most treasured possessions without our willing it? Had
Orlando, worn out by the extremity of his suffering, died for a
week, and then come to life again? And if so, of what nature is
death and of what nature life? Having waited well over half an hour
for an answer to these questions, and none coming, let us get on
with the story.</p>
<p>Now Orlando gave himself up to a life of extreme solitude. His
disgrace at Court and the violence of his grief were partly the
reason of it, but as he made no effort to defend himself and seldom
invited anyone to visit him (though he had many friends who would
willingly have done so) it appeared as if to be alone in the great
house of his fathers suited his temper. Solitude was his choice.
How he spent his time, nobody quite knew. The servants, of whom he
kept a full retinue, though much of their business was to dust
empty rooms and to smooth the coverlets of beds that were never
slept in, watched, in the dark of the evening, as they sat over
their cakes and ale, a light passing along the galleries, through
the banqueting-halls, up the staircase, into the bedrooms, and knew
that their master was perambulating the house alone. None dared
follow him, for the house was haunted by a great variety of ghosts,
and the extent of it made it easy to lose one’s way and either fall
down some hidden staircase or open a door which, should the wind
blow it to, would shut upon one for ever — accidents of no uncommon
occurrence, as the frequent discovery of the skeletons of men and
animals in attitudes of great agony made evident. Then the light
would be lost altogether, and Mrs Grimsditch, the housekeeper,
would say to Mr Dupper, the chaplain, how she hoped his Lordship
had not met with some bad accident. Mr Dupper would opine that his
Lordship was on his knees, no doubt, among the tombs of his
ancestors in the Chapel, which was in the Billiard Table Court,
half a mile away on the south side. For he had sins on his
conscience, Mr Dupper was afraid; upon which Mrs Grimsditch would
retort, rather sharply, that so had most of us; and Mrs Stewkley
and Mrs Field and old Nurse Carpenter would all raise their voices
in his Lordship’s praise; and the grooms and the stewards would
swear that it was a thousand pities to see so fine a nobleman
moping about the house when he might be hunting the fox or chasing
the deer; and even the little laundry maids and scullery maids, the
Judys and the Faiths, who were handing round the tankards and
cakes, would pipe up their testimony to his Lordship’s gallantry;
for never was there a kinder gentleman, or one more free with those
little pieces of silver which serve to buy a knot of ribbon or put
a posy in one’s hair; until even the Blackamoor whom they called
Grace Robinson by way of making a Christian woman of her,
understood what they were at, and agreed that his Lordship was a
handsome, pleasant, darling gentleman in the only way she could,
that is to say by showing all her teeth at once in a broad grin. In
short, all his serving men and women held him in high respect, and
cursed the foreign Princess (but they called her by a coarser name
than that) who had brought him to this pass.</p>
<p>But though it was probably cowardice, or love of hot ale, that
led Mr Dupper to imagine his Lordship safe among the tombs so that
he need not go in search of him, it may well have been that Mr
Dupper was right. Orlando now took a strange delight in thoughts of
death and decay, and, after pacing the long galleries and ballrooms
with a taper in his hand, looking at picture after picture as if he
sought the likeness of somebody whom he could not find, would mount
into the family pew and sit for hours watching the banners stir and
the moonlight waver with a bat or death’s head moth to keep him
company. Even this was not enough for him, but he must descend into
the crypt where his ancestors lay, coffin piled upon coffin, for
ten generations together. The place was so seldom visited that the
rats made free with the lead work, and now a thigh bone would catch
at his cloak as he passed, or he would crack the skull of some old
Sir Malise as it rolled beneath his foot. It was a ghastly
sepulchre; dug deep beneath the foundations of the house as if the
first Lord of the family, who had come from France with the
Conqueror, had wished to testify how all pomp is built upon
corruption; how the skeleton lies beneath the flesh: how we that
dance and sing above must lie below; how the crimson velvet turns
to dust; how the ring (here Orlando, stooping his lantern, would
pick up a gold circle lacking a stone, that had rolled into a
corner) loses its ruby and the eye which was so lustrous shines no
more. ‘Nothing remains of all these Princes’, Orlando would say,
indulging in some pardonable exaggeration of their rank, ‘except
one digit,’ and he would take a skeleton hand in his and bend the
joints this way and that. ‘Whose hand was it?’ he went on to ask.
‘The right or the left? The hand of man or woman, of age or youth?
Had it urged the war horse, or plied the needle? Had it plucked the
rose, or grasped cold steel? Had it —’ but here either his
invention failed him or, what is more likely, provided him with so
many instances of what a hand can do that he shrank, as his wont
was, from the cardinal labour of composition, which is excision,
and he put it with the other bones, thinking how there was a writer
called Thomas Browne, a Doctor of Norwich, whose writing upon such
subjects took his fancy amazingly.</p>
<p>So, taking his lantern and seeing that the bones were in order,
for though romantic, he was singularly methodical and detested
nothing so much as a ball of string on the floor, let alone the
skull of an ancestor, he returned to that curious, moody pacing
down the galleries, looking for something among the pictures, which
was interrupted at length by a veritable spasm of sobbing, at the
sight of a Dutch snow scene by an unknown artist. Then it seemed to
him that life was not worth living any more. Forgetting the bones
of his ancestors and how life is founded on a grave, he stood there
shaken with sobs, all for the desire of a woman in Russian
trousers, with slanting eyes, a pouting mouth and pearls about her
neck. She had gone. She had left him. He was never to see her
again. And so he sobbed. And so he found his way back to his own
rooms; and Mrs Grimsditch, seeing the light in the window, put the
tankard from her lips and said Praise be to God, his Lordship was
safe in his room again; for she had been thinking all this while
that he was foully murdered.</p>
<p>Orlando now drew his chair up to the table; opened the works of
Sir Thomas Browne and proceeded to investigate the delicate
articulation of one of the doctor’s longest and most marvellously
contorted cogitations.</p>
<p>For though these are not matters on which a biographer can
profitably enlarge it is plain enough to those who have done a
reader’s part in making up from bare hints dropped here and there
the whole boundary and circumference of a living person; can hear
in what we only whisper a living voice; can see, often when we say
nothing about it, exactly what he looked like; know without a word
to guide them precisely what he thought — and it is for readers
such as these that we write — it is plain then to such a reader
that Orlando was strangely compounded of many humours — of
melancholy, of indolence, of passion, of love of solitude, to say
nothing of all those contortions and subtleties of temper which
were indicated on the first page, when he slashed at a dead
nigger’s head; cut it down; hung it chivalrously out of his reach
again and then betook himself to the windowseat with a book. The
taste for books was an early one. As a child he was sometimes found
at midnight by a page still reading. They took his taper away, and
he bred glow-worms to serve his purpose. They took the glow-worms
away, and he almost burnt the house down with a tinder. To put it
in a nutshell, leaving the novelist to smooth out the crumpled silk
and all its implications, he was a nobleman afflicted with a love
of literature. Many people of his time, still more of his rank,
escaped the infection and were thus free to run or ride or make
love at their own sweet will. But some were early infected by a
germ said to be bred of the pollen of the asphodel and to be blown
out of Greece and Italy, which was of so deadly a nature that it
would shake the hand as it was raised to strike, and cloud the eye
as it sought its prey, and make the tongue stammer as it declared
its love. It was the fatal nature of this disease to substitute a
phantom for reality, so that Orlando, to whom fortune had given
every gift — plate, linen, houses, men-servants, carpets, beds in
profusion — had only to open a book for the whole vast accumulation
to turn to mist. The nine acres of stone which were his house
vanished; one hundred and fifty indoor servants disappeared; his
eighty riding horses became invisible; it would take too long to
count the carpets, sofas, trappings, china, plate, cruets, chafing
dishes and other movables often of beaten gold, which evaporated
like so much sea mist under the miasma. So it was, and Orlando
would sit by himself, reading, a naked man.</p>
<p>The disease gained rapidly upon him now in his solitude. He
would read often six hours into the night; and when they came to
him for orders about the slaughtering of cattle or the harvesting
of wheat, he would push away his folio and look as if he did not
understand what was said to him. This was bad enough and wrung the
hearts of Hall, the falconer, of Giles, the groom, of Mrs
Grimsditch, the housekeeper, of Mr Dupper, the chaplain. A fine
gentleman like that, they said, had no need of books. Let him leave
books, they said, to the palsied or the dying. But worse was to
come. For once the disease of reading has laid upon the system it
weakens it so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge
which dwells in the inkpot and festers in the quill. The wretch
takes to writing. And while this is bad enough in a poor man, whose
only property is a chair and a table set beneath a leaky roof — for
he has not much to lose, after all — the plight of a rich man, who
has houses and cattle, maidservants, asses and linen, and yet
writes books, is pitiable in the extreme. The flavour of it all
goes out of him; he is riddled by hot irons; gnawed by vermin. He
would give every penny he has (such is the malignity of the germ)
to write one little book and become famous; yet all the gold in
Peru will not buy him the treasure of a well-turned line. So he
falls into consumption and sickness, blows his brains out, turns
his face to the wall. It matters not in what attitude they find
him. He has passed through the gates of Death and known the flames
of Hell.</p>
<p>Happily, Orlando was of a strong constitution and the disease
(for reasons presently to be given) never broke him down as it has
broken many of his peers. But he was deeply smitten with it, as the
sequel shows. For when he had read for an hour or so in Sir Thomas
Browne, and the bark of the stag and the call of the night watchman
showed that it was the dead of night and all safe asleep, he
crossed the room, took a silver key from his pocket and unlocked
the doors of a great inlaid cabinet which stood in the corner.
Within were some fifty drawers of cedar wood and upon each was a
paper neatly written in Orlando’s hand. He paused, as if hesitating
which to open. One was inscribed ‘The Death of Ajax’, another ‘The
Birth of Pyramus’, another ‘Iphigenia in Aulis’, another ‘The Death
of Hippolytus’, another ‘Meleager’, another ‘The Return of
Odysseus’ — in fact there was scarcely a single drawer that lacked
the name of some mythological personage at a crisis of his career.
In each drawer lay a document of considerable size all written over
in Orlando’s hand. The truth was that Orlando had been afflicted
thus for many years. Never had any boy begged apples as Orlando
begged paper; nor sweetmeats as he begged ink. Stealing away from
talk and games, he had hidden himself behind curtains, in priest’s
holes, or in the cupboard behind his mother’s bedroom which had a
great hole in the floor and smelt horribly of starling’s dung, with
an inkhorn in one hand, a pen in another, and on his knee a roll of
paper. Thus had been written, before he was turned twenty-five,
some forty-seven plays, histories, romances, poems; some in prose,
some in verse; some in French, some in Italian; all romantic, and
all long. One he had had printed by John Ball of the Feathers and
Coronet opposite St Paul’s Cross, Cheapside; but though the sight
of it gave him extreme delight, he had never dared show it even to
his mother, since to write, much more to publish, was, he knew, for
a nobleman an inexpiable disgrace.</p>
<p>Now, however, that it was the dead of night and he was alone, he
chose from this repository one thick document called ‘Xenophila a
Tragedy’ or some such title, and one thin one, called simply ‘The
Oak Tree’ (this was the only monosyllabic title among the lot), and
then he approached the inkhorn, fingered the quill, and made other
such passes as those addicted to this vice begin their rites with.
But he paused.</p>
<p>As this pause was of extreme significance in his history, more
so, indeed, than many acts which bring men to their knees and make
rivers run with blood, it behoves us to ask why he paused; and to
reply, after due reflection, that it was for some such reason as
this. Nature, who has played so many queer tricks upon us, making
us so unequally of clay and diamonds, of rainbow and granite, and
stuffed them into a case, often of the most incongruous, for the
poet has a butcher’s face and the butcher a poet’s; nature, who
delights in muddle and mystery, so that even now (the first of
November 1927) we know not why we go upstairs, or why we come down
again, our most daily movements are like the passage of a ship on
an unknown sea, and the sailors at the mast-head ask, pointing
their glasses to the horizon; Is there land or is there none? to
which, if we are prophets, we make answer ‘Yes’; if we are truthful
we say ‘No’; nature, who has so much to answer for besides the
perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence, has further complicated
her task and added to our confusion by providing not only a perfect
rag-bag of odds and ends within us — a piece of a policeman’s
trousers lying cheek by jowl with Queen Alexandra’s wedding veil —
but has contrived that the whole assortment shall be lightly
stitched together by a single thread. Memory is the seamstress, and
a capricious one at that. Memory runs her needle in and out, up and
down, hither and thither. We know not what comes next, or what
follows after. Thus, the most ordinary movement in the world, such
as sitting down at a table and pulling the inkstand towards one,
may agitate a thousand odd, disconnected fragments, now bright, now
dim, hanging and bobbing and dipping and flaunting, like the
underlinen of a family of fourteen on a line in a gale of wind.
Instead of being a single, downright, bluff piece of work of which
no man need feel ashamed, our commonest deeds are set about with a
fluttering and flickering of wings, a rising and falling of lights.
Thus it was that Orlando, dipping his pen in the ink, saw the
mocking face of the lost Princess and asked himself a million
questions instantly which were as arrows dipped in gall. Where was
she; and why had she left him? Was the Ambassador her uncle or her
lover? Had they plotted? Was she forced? Was she married? Was she
dead? — all of which so drove their venom into him that, as if to
vent his agony somewhere, he plunged his quill so deep into the
inkhorn that the ink spirted over the table, which act, explain it
how one may (and no explanation perhaps is possible — Memory is
inexplicable), at once substituted for the face of the Princess a
face of a very different sort. But whose was it, he asked himself?
And he had to wait, perhaps half a minute, looking at the new
picture which lay on top of the old, as one lantern slide is half
seen through the next, before he could say to himself, ‘This is the
face of that rather fat, shabby man who sat in Twitchett’s room
ever so many years ago when old Queen Bess came here to dine; and I
saw him,’ Orlando continued, catching at another of those little
coloured rags, ‘sitting at the table, as I peeped in on my way
downstairs, and he had the most amazing eyes,’ said Orlando, ‘that
ever were, but who the devil was he?’ Orlando asked, for here
Memory added to the forehead and eyes, first, a coarse,
grease-stained ruffle, then a brown doublet, and finally a pair of
thick boots such as citizens wear in Cheapside. ‘Not a Nobleman;
not one of us,’ said Orlando (which he would not have said aloud,
for he was the most courteous of gentlemen; but it shows what an
effect noble birth has upon the mind and incidentally how difficult
it is for a nobleman to be a writer), ‘a poet, I dare say.’ By all
the laws, Memory, having disturbed him sufficiently, should now
have blotted the whole thing out completely, or have fetched up
something so idiotic and out of keeping — like a dog chasing a cat
or an old woman blowing her nose into a red cotton handkerchief —
that, in despair of keeping pace with her vagaries, Orlando should
have struck his pen in earnest against his paper. (For we can, if
we have the resolution, turn the hussy, Memory, and all her ragtag
and bobtail out of the house.) But Orlando paused. Memory still
held before him the image of a shabby man with big, bright eyes.
Still he looked, still he paused. It is these pauses that are our
undoing. It is then that sedition enters the fortress and our
troops rise in insurrection. Once before he had paused, and love
with its horrid rout, its shawms, its cymbals, and its heads with
gory locks torn from the shoulders had burst in. From love he had
suffered the tortures of the damned. Now, again, he paused, and
into the breach thus made, leapt Ambition, the harridan, and
Poetry, the witch, and Desire of Fame, the strumpet; all joined
hands and made of his heart their dancing ground. Standing upright
in the solitude of his room, he vowed that he would be the first
poet of his race and bring immortal lustre upon his name. He said
(reciting the names and exploits of his ancestors) that Sir Boris
had fought and killed the Paynim; Sir Gawain, the Turk; Sir Miles,
the Pole; Sir Andrew, the Frank; Sir Richard, the Austrian; Sir
Jordan, the Frenchman; and Sir Herbert, the Spaniard. But of all
that killing and campaigning, that drinking and love-making, that
spending and hunting and riding and eating, what remained? A skull;
a finger. Whereas, he said, turning to the page of Sir Thomas
Browne, which lay open upon the table — and again he paused. Like
an incantation rising from all parts of the room, from the night
wind and the moonlight, rolled the divine melody of those words
which, lest they should outstare this page, we will leave where
they lie entombed, not dead, embalmed rather, so fresh is their
colour, so sound their breathing — and Orlando, comparing that
achievement with those of his ancestors, cried out that they and
their deeds were dust and ashes, but this man and his words were
immortal.</p>
<p>He soon perceived, however, that the battles which Sir Miles and
the rest had waged against armed knights to win a kingdom, were not
half so arduous as this which he now undertook to win immortality
against the English language. Anyone moderately familiar with the
rigours of composition will not need to be told the story in
detail; how he wrote and it seemed good; read and it seemed vile;
corrected and tore up; cut out; put in; was in ecstasy; in despair;
had his good nights and bad mornings; snatched at ideas and lost
them; saw his book plain before him and it vanished; acted his
people’s parts as he ate; mouthed them as he walked; now cried; now
laughed; vacillated between this style and that; now preferred the
heroic and pompous; next the plain and simple; now the vales of
Tempe; then the fields of Kent or Cornwall; and could not decide
whether he was the divinest genius or the greatest fool in the
world.</p>
<p>It was to settle this last question that he decided after many
months of such feverish labour, to break the solitude of years and
communicate with the outer world. He had a friend in London, one
Giles Isham, of Norfolk, who, though of gentle birth, was
acquainted with writers and could doubtless put him in touch with
some member of that blessed, indeed sacred, fraternity. For, to
Orlando in the state he was now in, there was a glory about a man
who had written a book and had it printed, which outshone all the
glories of blood and state. To his imagination it seemed as if even
the bodies of those instinct with such divine thoughts must be
transfigured. They must have aureoles for hair, incense for breath,
and roses must grow between their lips — which was certainly not
true either of himself or Mr Dupper. He could think of no greater
happiness than to be allowed to sit behind a curtain and hear them
talk. Even the imagination of that bold and various discourse made
the memory of what he and his courtier friends used to talk about —
a dog, a horse, a woman, a game of cards — seem brutish in the
extreme. He bethought him with pride that he had always been called
a scholar, and sneered at for his love of solitude and books. He
had never been apt at pretty phrases. He would stand stock still,
blush, and stride like a grenadier in a ladies’ drawing-room. He
had twice fallen, in sheer abstraction, from his horse. He had
broken Lady Winchilsea’s fan once while making a rhyme. Eagerly
recalling these and other instances of his unfitness for the life
of society, an ineffable hope, that all the turbulence of his
youth, his clumsiness, his blushes, his long walks, and his love of
the country proved that he himself belonged to the sacred race
rather than to the noble — was by birth a writer, rather than an
aristocrat — possessed him. For the first time since the night of
the great flood he was happy.</p>
<p>He now commissioned Mr Isham of Norfolk to deliver to Mr
Nicholas Greene of Clifford’s Inn a document which set forth
Orlando’s admiration for his works (for Nick Greene was a very
famous writer at that time) and his desire to make his
acquaintance; which he scarcely dared ask; for he had nothing to
offer in return; but if Mr Nicholas Greene would condescend to
visit him, a coach and four would be at the corner of Fetter Lane
at whatever hour Mr Greene chose to appoint, and bring him safely
to Orlando’s house. One may fill up the phrases which then
followed; and figure Orlando’s delight when, in no long time, Mr
Greene signified his acceptance of the Noble Lord’s invitation;
took his place in the coach and was set down in the hall to the
south of the main building punctually at seven o’clock on Monday,
April the twenty-first.</p>
<p>Many Kings, Queens, and Ambassadors had been received there;
Judges had stood there in their ermine. The loveliest ladies of the
land had come there; and the sternest warriors. Banners hung there
which had been at Flodden and at Agincourt. There were displayed
the painted coats of arms with their lions and their leopards and
their coronets. There were the long tables where the gold and
silver plate was stood; and there the vast fireplaces of wrought
Italian marble where nightly a whole oak tree, with its million
leaves and its nests of rook and wren, was burnt to ashes. Nicholas
Greene, the poet stood there now, plainly dressed in his slouched
hat and black doublet, carrying in one hand a small bag.</p>
<p>That Orlando as he hastened to greet him was slightly
disappointed was inevitable. The poet was not above middle height;
was of a mean figure; was lean and stooped somewhat, and, stumbling
over the mastiff on entering, the dog bit him. Moreover, Orlando
for all his knowledge of mankind was puzzled where to place him.
There was something about him which belonged neither to servant,
squire, or noble. The head with its rounded forehead and beaked
nose was fine, but the chin receded. The eyes were brilliant, but
the lips hung loose and slobbered. It was the expression of the
face — as a whole, however, that was disquieting. There was none of
that stately composure which makes the faces of the nobility so
pleasing to look at; nor had it anything of the dignified servility
of a well-trained domestic’s face; it was a face seamed, puckered,
and drawn together. Poet though he was, it seemed as if he were
more used to scold than to flatter; to quarrel than to coo; to
scramble than to ride; to struggle than to rest; to hate than to
love. This, too, was shown by the quickness of his movements; and
by something fiery and suspicious in his glance. Orlando was
somewhat taken aback. But they went to dinner.</p>
<p>Here, Orlando, who usually took such things for granted, was,
for the first time, unaccountably ashamed of the number of his
servants and of the splendour of his table. Stranger still, he
bethought him with pride — for the thought was generally
distasteful — of that great grandmother Moll who had milked the
cows. He was about somehow to allude to this humble woman and her
milk-pails, when the poet forestalled him by saying that it was
odd, seeing how common the name of Greene was, that the family had
come over with the Conqueror and was of the highest nobility in
France. Unfortunately, they had come down in the world and done
little more than leave their name to the royal borough of
Greenwich. Further talk of the same sort, about lost castles, coats
of arms, cousins who were baronets in the north, intermarriage with
noble families in the west, how some Greens spelt the name with an
e at the end, and others without, lasted till the venison was on
the table. Then Orlando contrived to say something of Grandmother
Moll and her cows, and had eased his heart a little of its burden
by the time the wild fowl were before them. But it was not until
the Malmsey was passing freely that Orlando dared mention what he
could not help thinking a more important matter than the Greens or
the cows; that is to say the sacred subject of poetry. At the first
mention of the word, the poet’s eyes flashed fire; he dropped the
fine gentleman airs he had worn; thumped his glass on the table,
and launched into one of the longest, most intricate, most
passionate, and bitterest stories that Orlando had ever heard, save
from the lips of a jilted woman, about a play of his; another poet;
and a critic. Of the nature of poetry itself, Orlando only gathered
that it was harder to sell than prose, and though the lines were
shorter took longer in the writing. So the talk went on with
ramifications interminable, until Orlando ventured to hint that he
had himself been so rash as to write — but here the poet leapt from
his chair. A mouse had squeaked in the wainscot, he said. The truth
was, he explained, that his nerves were in a state where a mouse’s
squeak upset them for a fortnight. Doubtless the house was full of
vermin, but Orlando had not heard them. The poet then gave Orlando
the full story of his health for the past ten years or so. It had
been so bad that one could only marvel that he still lived. He had
had the palsy, the gout, the ague, the dropsy, and the three sorts
of fever in succession; added to which he had an enlarged heart, a
great spleen, and a diseased liver. But, above all, he had, he told
Orlando, sensations in his spine which defied description. There
was one knob about the third from the top which burnt like fire;
another about second from the bottom which was cold as ice.
Sometimes he woke with a brain like lead; at others it was as if a
thousand wax tapers were alight and people were throwing fireworks
inside him. He could feel a rose leaf through his mattress, he
said; and knew his way almost about London by the feel of the
cobbles. Altogether he was a piece of machinery so finely made and
curiously put together (here he raised his hand as if
unconsciously, and indeed it was of the finest shape imaginable)
that it confounded him to think that he had only sold five hundred
copies of his poem, but that of course was largely due to the
conspiracy against him. All he could say, he concluded, banging his
fist upon the table, was that the art of poetry was dead in
England.</p>
<p>How that could be with Shakespeare, Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Browne,
Donne, all now writing or just having written, Orlando, reeling off
the names of his favourite heroes, could not think.</p>
<p>Greene laughed sardonically. Shakespeare, he admitted, had
written some scenes that were well enough; but he had taken them
chiefly from Marlowe. Marlowe was a likely boy, but what could you
say of a lad who died before he was thirty? As for Browne, he was
for writing poetry in prose, and people soon got tired of such
conceits as that. Donne was a mountebank who wrapped up his lack of
meaning in hard words. The gulls were taken in; but the style would
be out of fashion twelve months hence. As for Ben Jonson — Ben
Jonson was a friend of his and he never spoke ill of his
friends.</p>
<p>No, he concluded, the great age of literature is past; the great
age of literature was the Greek; the Elizabethan age was inferior
in every respect to the Greek. In such ages men cherished a divine
ambition which he might call La Gloire (he pronounced it Glawr, so
that Orlando did not at first catch his meaning). Now all young
writers were in the pay of the booksellers and poured out any trash
that would sell. Shakespeare was the chief offender in this way and
Shakespeare was already paying the penalty. Their own age, he said,
was marked by precious conceits and wild experiments — neither of
which the Greeks would have tolerated for a moment. Much though it
hurt him to say it — for he loved literature as he loved his life —
he could see no good in the present and had no hope for the future.
Here he poured himself out another glass of wine.</p>
<p>Orlando was shocked by these doctrines; yet could not help
observing that the critic himself seemed by no means downcast. On
the contrary, the more he denounced his own time, the more
complacent he became. He could remember, he said, a night at the
Cock Tavern in Fleet Street when Kit Marlowe was there and some
others. Kit was in high feather, rather drunk, which he easily
became, and in a mood to say silly things. He could see him now,
brandishing his glass at the company and hiccoughing out, ‘Stap my
vitals, Bill’ (this was to Shakespeare), ‘there’s a great wave
coming and you’re on the top of it,’ by which he meant, Greene
explained, that they were trembling on the verge of a great age in
English literature, and that Shakespeare was to be a poet of some
importance. Happily for himself, he was killed two nights later in
a drunken brawl, and so did not live to see how this prediction
turned out. ‘Poor foolish fellow,’ said Greene, ‘to go and say a
thing like that. A great age, forsooth — the Elizabethan a great
age!’</p>
<p>‘So, my dear Lord,’ he continued, settling himself comfortably
in his chair and rubbing the wine-glass between his fingers, ‘we
must make the best of it, cherish the past and honour those writers
— there are still a few of ‘em — who take antiquity for their model
and write, not for pay but for Glawr.’ (Orlando could have wished
him a better accent.) ‘Glawr’, said Greene, ‘is the spur of noble
minds. Had I a pension of three hundred pounds a year paid
quarterly, I would live for Glawr alone. I would lie in bed every
morning reading Cicero. I would imitate his style so that you
couldn’t tell the difference between us. That’s what I call fine
writing,’ said Greene; ‘that’s what I call Glawr. But it’s
necessary to have a pension to do it.’</p>
<p>By this time Orlando had abandoned all hope of discussing his
own work with the poet; but this mattered the less as the talk now
got upon the lives and characters of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and
the rest, all of whom Greene had known intimately and about whom he
had a thousand anecdotes of the most amusing kind to tell. Orlando
had never laughed so much in his life. These, then, were his gods!
Half were drunken and all were amorous. Most of them quarrelled
with their wives; not one of them was above a lie or an intrigue of
the most paltry kind. Their poetry was scribbled down on the backs
of washing bills held to the heads of printer’s devils at the
street door. Thus Hamlet went to press; thus Lear; thus Othello. No
wonder, as Greene said, that these plays show the faults they do.
The rest of the time was spent in carousings and junketings in
taverns and in beer gardens, When things were said that passed
belief for wit, and things were done that made the utmost frolic of
the courtiers seem pale in comparison. All this Greene told with a
spirit that roused Orlando to the highest pitch of delight. He had
a power of mimicry that brought the dead to life, and could say the
finest things of books provided they were written three hundred
years ago.</p>
<p>So time passed, and Orlando felt for his guest a strange mixture
of liking and contempt, of admiration and pity, as well as
something too indefinite to be called by any one name, but had
something of fear in it and something of fascination. He talked
incessantly about himself, yet was such good company that one could
listen to the story of his ague for ever. Then he was so witty;
then he was so irreverent; then he made so free with the names of
God and Woman; then he was So full of queer crafts and had such
strange lore in his head; could make salad in three hundred
different ways; knew all that could be known of the mixing of
wines; played half-a-dozen musical instruments, and was the first
person, and perhaps the last, to toast cheese in the great Italian
fireplace. That he did not know a geranium from a carnation, an oak
from a birch tree, a mastiff from a greyhound, a teg from a ewe,
wheat from barley, plough land from fallow; was ignorant of the
rotation of the crops; thought oranges grew underground and turnips
on trees; preferred any townscape to any landscape; — all this and
much more amazed Orlando, who had never met anybody of his kind
before. Even the maids, who despised him, tittered at his jokes,
and the men-servants, who loathed him, hung about to hear his
stories. Indeed, the house had never been so lively as now that he
was there — all of which gave Orlando a great deal to think about,
and caused him to compare this way of life with the old. He
recalled the sort of talk he had been used to about the King of
Spain’s apoplexy or the mating of a bitch; he bethought him how the
day passed between the stables and the dressing closet; he
remembered how the Lords snored over their wine and hated anybody
who woke them up. He bethought him how active and valiant they were
in body; how slothful and timid in mind. Worried by these thoughts,
and unable to strike a proper balance, he came to the conclusion
that he had admitted to his house a plaguey spirit of unrest that
would never suffer him to sleep sound again.</p>
<p>At the same moment, Nick Greene came to precisely the opposite
conclusion. Lying in bed of a morning on the softest pillows
between the smoothest sheets and looking out of his oriel window
upon turf which for centuries had known neither dandelion nor dock
weed, he thought that unless he could somehow make his escape, he
should be smothered alive. Getting up and hearing the pigeons coo,
dressing and hearing the fountains fall, he thought that unless he
could hear the drays roar upon the cobbles of Fleet Street, he
would never write another line. If this goes on much longer, he
thought, hearing the footman mend the fire and spread the table
with silver dishes next door, I shall fall asleep and (here he gave
a prodigious yawn) sleeping die.</p>
<p>So he sought Orlando in his room, and explained that he had not
been able to sleep a wink all night because of the silence.
(Indeed, the house was surrounded by a park fifteen miles in
circumference and a wall ten feet high.) Silence, he said, was of
all things the most oppressive to his nerves. He would end his
visit, by Orlando’s leave, that very morning. Orlando felt some
relief at this, yet also a great reluctance to let him go. The
house, he thought, would seem very dull without him. On parting
(for he had never yet liked to mention the subject), he had the
temerity to press his play upon the Death of Hercules upon the poet
and ask his opinion of it. The poet took it; muttered something
about Glawr and Cicero, which Orlando cut short by promising to pay
the pension quarterly; whereupon Greene, with many protestations of
affection, jumped into the coach and was gone.</p>
<p>The great hall had never seemed so large, so splendid, or so
empty as the chariot rolled away. Orlando knew that he would never
have the heart to make toasted cheese in the Italian fireplace
again. He would never have the wit to crack jokes about Italian
pictures; never have the skill to mix punch as it should be mixed;
a thousand good quips and cranks would be lost to him. Yet what a
relief to be out of the sound of that querulous voice, what a
luxury to be alone once more, so he could not help reflecting, as
he unloosed the mastiff which had been tied up these six weeks
because it never saw the poet without biting him.</p>
<p>Nick Greene was set down at the corner of Fetter Lane that same
afternoon, and found things going on much as he had left them. Mrs
Greene, that is to say, was giving birth to a baby in one room; Tom
Fletcher was drinking gin in another. Books were tumbled all about
the floor; dinner — such as it was — was set on a dressing-table
where the children had been making mud pies. But this, Greene felt,
was the atmosphere for writing, here he could write, and write he
did. The subject was made for him. A noble Lord at home. A visit to
a Nobleman in the country — his new poem was to have some such
title as that. Seizing the pen with which his little boy was
tickling the cat’s ears, and dipping it in the egg-cup which served
for inkpot, Greene dashed off a very spirited satire there and
then. It was so done to a turn that no one could doubt that the
young Lord who was roasted was Orlando; his most private sayings
and doings, his enthusiasms and folies, down to the very colour of
his hair and the foreign way he had of rolling his r’s, were there
to the life. And if there had been any doubt about it, Greene
clinched the matter by introducing, with scarcely any disguise,
passages from that aristocratic tragedy, the Death of Hercules,
which he found as he expected, wordy and bombastic in the
extreme.</p>
<p>The pamphlet, which ran at once into several editions, and paid
the expenses of Mrs Greene’s tenth lying-in, was soon sent by
friends who take care of such matters to Orlando himself. When he
had read it, which he did with deadly composure from start to
finish, he rang for the footman; delivered the document to him at
the end of a pair of tongs; bade him drop it in the filthiest heart
of the foulest midden on the estate. Then, when the man was turning
to go he stopped him, ‘Take the swiftest horse in the stable,’ he
said, ‘ride for dear life to Harwich. There embark upon a ship
which you will find bound for Norway. Buy for me from the King’s
own kennels the finest elk-hounds of the Royal strain, male and
female. Bring them back without delay. For’, he murmured, scarcely
above his breath as he turned to his books, ‘I have done with
men.’</p>
<p>The footman, who was perfectly trained in his duties, bowed and
disappeared. He fulfilled his task so efficiently that he was back
that day three weeks, leading in his hand a leash of the finest
elk-hounds, one of whom, a female, gave birth that very night under
the dinner-table to a litter of eight fine puppies. Orlando had
them brought to his bedchamber.</p>
<p>‘For’, he said, ‘I have done with men.’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he paid the pension quarterly.</p>
<p>Thus, at the age of thirty, or thereabouts, this young Nobleman
had not only had every experience that life has to offer, but had
seen the worthlessness of them all. Love and ambition, women and
poets were all equally vain. Literature was a farce. The night
after reading Greene’s Visit to a Nobleman in the Country, he burnt
in a great conflagration fifty-seven poetical works, only retaining
‘The Oak Tree’, which was his boyish dream and very short. Two
things alone remained to him in which he now put any trust: dogs
and nature; an elk-hound and a rose bush. The world, in all its
variety, life in all its complexity, had shrunk to that. Dogs and a
bush were the whole of it. So feeling quit of a vast mountain of
illusion, and very naked in consequence, he called his hounds to
him and strode through the Park.</p>
<p>So long had he been secluded, writing and reading, that he had
half forgotten the amenities of nature, which in June can be great.
When he reached that high mound whence on fine days half of England
with a slice of Wales and Scotland thrown in can be seen, he flung
himself under his favourite oak tree and felt that if he need never
speak to another man or woman so long as he lived; if his dogs did
not develop the faculty of speech; if he never met a poet or a
Princess again, he might make out what years remained to him in
tolerable content.</p>
<p>Here he came then, day after day, week after week, month after
month, year after year. He saw the beech trees turn golden and the
young ferns unfurl; he saw the moon sickle and then circular; he
saw — but probably the reader can imagine the passage which should
follow and how every tree and plant in the neighbourhood is
described first green, then golden; how moons rise and suns set;
how spring follows winter and autumn summer; how night succeeds day
and day night; how there is first a storm and then fine weather;
how things remain much as they are for two or three hundred years
or so, except for a little dust and a few cobwebs which one old
woman can sweep up in half an hour; a conclusion which, one cannot
help feeling, might have been reached more quickly by the simple
statement that ‘Time passed’ (here the exact amount could be
indicated in brackets) and nothing whatever happened.</p>
<p>But Time, unfortunately, though it makes animals and vegetables
bloom and fade with amazing punctuality, has no such simple effect
upon the mind of man. The mind of man, moreover, works with equal
strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the
queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a
hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be
accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second.
This extraordinary discrepancy between time on the clock and time
in the mind is less known than it should be and deserves fuller
investigation. But the biographer, whose interests are, as we have
said, highly restricted, must confine himself to one simple
statement: when a man has reached the age of thirty, as Orlando now
had, time when he is thinking becomes inordinately long; time when
he is doing becomes inordinately short. Thus Orlando gave his
orders and did the business of his vast estates in a flash; but
directly he was alone on the mound under the oak tree, the seconds
began to round and fill until it seemed as if they would never
fall. They filled themselves, moreover, with the strangest variety
of objects. For not only did he find himself confronted by problems
which have puzzled the wisest of men, such as What is love? What
friendship? What truth? but directly he came to think about them,
his whole past, which seemed to him of extreme length and variety,
rushed into the falling second, swelled it a dozen times its
natural size, coloured it a thousand tints, and filled it with all
the odds and ends in the universe.</p>
<p>In such thinking (or by whatever name it should be called) he
spent months and years of his life. It would be no exaggeration to
say that he would go out after breakfast a man of thirty and come
home to dinner a man of fifty-five at least. Some weeks added a
century to his age, others no more than three seconds at most.
Altogether, the task of estimating the length of human life (of the
animals’ we presume not to speak) is beyond our capacity, for
directly we say that it is ages long, we are reminded that it is
briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground. Of the two
forces which alternately, and what is more confusing still, at the
same moment, dominate our unfortunate numbskulls — brevity and
diuturnity — Orlando was sometimes under the influence of the
elephant-footed deity, then of the gnat-winged fly. Life seemed to
him of prodigious length. Yet even so, it went like a flash. But
even when it stretched longest and the moments swelled biggest and
he seemed to wander alone in deserts of vast eternity, there was no
time for the smoothing out and deciphering of those scored
parchments which thirty years among men and women had rolled tight
in his heart and brain. Long before he had done thinking about Love
(the oak tree had put forth its leaves and shaken them to the
ground a dozen times in the process) Ambition would jostle it off
the field, to be replaced by Friendship or Literature. And as the
first question had not been settled — What is Love? — back it would
come at the least provocation or none, and hustle Books or
Metaphors of What one lives for into the margin, there to wait till
they saw their chance to rush into the field again. What made the
process still longer was that it was profusely illustrated, not
only with pictures, as that of old Queen Elizabeth, laid on her
tapestry couch in rose-coloured brocade with an ivory snuff-box in
her hand and a gold-hilted sword by her side, but with scents — she
was strongly perfumed — and with sounds; the stags were barking in
Richmond Park that winter’s day. And so, the thought of love would
be all ambered over with snow and winter; with log fires burning;
with Russian women, gold swords, and the bark of stags; with old
King James’ slobbering and fireworks and sacks of treasure in the
holds of Elizabethan sailing ships. Every single thing, once he
tried to dislodge it from its place in his mind, he found thus
cumbered with other matter like the lump of glass which, after a
year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with bones and
dragon-flies, and coins and the tresses of drowned women.</p>
<p>‘Another metaphor by Jupiter!’ he would exclaim as he said this
(which will show the disorderly and circuitous way in which his
mind worked and explain why the oak tree flowered and faded so
often before he came to any conclusion about Love). ‘And what’s the
point of it?’ he would ask himself. ‘Why not say simply in so many
words —’ and then he would try to think for half an hour — or was
it two years and a half? — how to say simply in so many words what
love is. ‘A figure like that is manifestly untruthful,’ he argued,
‘for no dragon-fly, unless under very exceptional circumstances,
could live at the bottom of the sea. And if literature is not the
Bride and Bedfellow of Truth, what is she? Confound it all,’ he
cried, ‘why say Bedfellow when one’s already said Bride? Why not
simply say what one means and leave it?’</p>
<p>So then he tried saying the grass is green and the sky is blue
and so to propitiate the austere spirit of poetry whom still,
though at a great distance, he could not help reverencing. ‘The sky
is blue,’ he said, ‘the grass is green.’ Looking up, he saw that,
on the contrary, the sky is like the veils which a thousand
Madonnas have let fall from their hair; and the grass fleets and
darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs
from enchanted woods. ‘Upon my word,’ he said (for he had fallen
into the bad habit of speaking aloud), ‘I don’t see that one’s more
true than another. Both are utterly false.’ And he despaired of
being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is
and fell into a deep dejection.</p>
<p>And here we may profit by a pause in his soliloquy to reflect
how odd it was to see Orlando stretched there on his elbow on a
June day and to reflect that this fine fellow with all his
faculties about him and a healthy body, witness cheeks and limbs —
a man who never thought twice about heading a charge or fighting a
duel — should be so subject to the lethargy of thought, and
rendered so susceptible by it, that when it came to a question of
poetry, or his own competence in it, he was as shy as a little girl
behind her mother’s cottage door. In our belief, Greene’s ridicule
of his tragedy hurt him as much as the Princess’ ridicule of his
love. But to return:—</p>
<p>Orlando went on thinking. He kept looking at the grass and at
the sky and trying to bethink him what a true poet, who has his
verses published in London, would say about them. Memory meanwhile
(whose habits have already been described) kept steady before his
eyes the face of Nicholas Greene, as if that sardonic loose-lipped
man, treacherous as he had proved himself, were the Muse in person,
and it was to him that Orlando must do homage. So Orlando, that
summer morning, offered him a variety of phrases, some plain,
others figured, and Nick Greene kept shaking his head and sneering
and muttering something about Glawr and Cicero and the death of
poetry in our time. At length, starting to his feet (it was now
winter and very cold) Orlando swore one of the most remarkable
oaths of his lifetime, for it bound him to a servitude than which
none is stricter. ‘I’ll be blasted’, he said, ‘if I ever write
another word, or try to write another word, to please Nick Greene
or the Muse. Bad, good, or indifferent, I’ll write, from this day
forward, to please myself’; and here he made as if he were tearing
a whole budget of papers across and tossing them in the face of
that sneering loose-lipped man. Upon which, as a cur ducks if you
stoop to shy a stone at him, Memory ducked her effigy of Nick
Greene out of sight; and substituted for it — nothing whatever.</p>
<p>But Orlando, all the same, went on thinking. He had indeed much
to think of. For when he tore the parchment across, he tore, in one
rending, the scrolloping, emblazoned scroll which he had made out
in his own favour in the solitude of his room appointing himself,
as the King appoints Ambassadors, the first poet of his race, the
first writer of his age, conferring eternal immortality upon his
soul and granting his body a grave among laurels and the intangible
banners of a people’s reverence perpetually. Eloquent as this all
was, he now tore it up and threw it in the dustbin. ‘Fame’, he
said. ‘is like’ (and since there was no Nick Greene to stop him, he
went on to revel in images of which we will choose only one or two
of the quietest) ‘a braided coat which hampers the limbs; a jacket
of silver which curbs the heart; a painted shield which covers a
scarecrow,’ etc. etc. The pith of his phrases was that while fame
impedes and constricts, obscurity wraps about a man like a mist;
obscurity is dark, ample, and free; obscurity lets the mind take
its way unimpeded. Over the obscure man is poured the merciful
suffusion of darkness. None knows where he goes or comes. He may
seek the truth and speak it; he alone is free; he alone is
truthful; he alone is at peace. And so he sank into a quiet mood,
under the oak tree, the hardness of whose roots, exposed above the
ground, seemed to him rather comfortable than otherwise.</p>
<p>Sunk for a long time in profound thoughts as to the value of
obscurity, and the delight of having no name, but being like a wave
which returns to the deep body of the sea; thinking how obscurity
rids the mind of the irk of envy and spite; how it sets running in
the veins the free waters of generosity and magnanimity; and allows
giving and taking without thanks offered or praise given; which
must have been the way of all great poets, he supposed (though his
knowledge of Greek was not enough to bear him out), for, he
thought, Shakespeare must have written like that, and the church
builders built like that, anonymously, needing no thanking or
naming, but only their work in the daytime and a little ale perhaps
at night —’What an admirable life this is,’ he thought, stretching
his limbs out under the oak tree. ‘And why not enjoy it this very
moment?’ The thought struck him like a bullet. Ambition dropped
like a plummet. Rid of the heart-burn of rejected love, and of
vanity rebuked, and all the other stings and pricks which the
nettle-bed of life had burnt upon him when ambitious of fame, but
could no longer inflict upon one careless of glory, he opened his
eyes, which had been wide open all the time, but had seen only
thoughts, and saw, lying in the hollow beneath him, his house.</p>
<p>There it lay in the early sunshine of spring. It looked a town
rather than a house, but a town built, not hither and thither, as
this man wished or that, but circumspectly, by a single architect
with one idea in his head. Courts and buildings, grey, red, plum
colour, lay orderly and symmetrical; the courts were some of them
oblong and some square; in this was a fountain; in that a statue;
the buildings were some of them low, some pointed; here was a
chapel, there a belfry; spaces of the greenest grass lay in between
and clumps of cedar trees and beds of bright flowers; all were
clasped — yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part
had room to spread itself fittingly — by the roll of a massive
wall; while smoke from innumerable chimneys curled perpetually into
the air. This vast, yet ordered building, which could house a
thousand men and perhaps two thousand horses, was built, Orlando
thought, by workmen whose names are unknown. Here have lived, for
more centuries than I can count, the obscure generations of my own
obscure family. Not one of these Richards, Johns, Annes, Elizabeths
has left a token of himself behind him, yet all, working together
with their spades and their needles, their love-making and their
child-bearing, have left this.</p>
<p>Never had the house looked more noble and humane.</p>
<p>Why, then, had he wished to raise himself above them? For it
seemed vain and arrogant in the extreme to try to better that
anonymous work of creation; the labours of those vanished hands.
Better was it to go unknown and leave behind you an arch, a potting
shed, a wall where peaches ripen, than to burn like a meteor and
leave no dust. For after all, he said, kindling as he looked at the
great house on the greensward below, the unknown lords and ladies
who lived there never forgot to set aside something for those who
come after; for the roof that will leak; for the tree that will
fall. There was always a warm corner for the old shepherd in the
kitchen; always food for the hungry; always their goblets were
polished, though they lay sick, and their windows were lit though
they lay dying. Lords though they were, they were content to go
down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone-mason.
Obscure noblemen, forgotten builders — thus he apostrophized them
with a warmth that entirely gainsaid such critics as called him
cold, indifferent, slothful (the truth being that a quality often
lies just on the other side of the wall from where we seek it)—
thus he apostrophized his house and race in terms of the most
moving eloquence; but when it came to the peroration — and what is
eloquence that lacks a peroration? — he fumbled. He would have
liked to have ended with a flourish to the effect that he would
follow in their footsteps and add another stone to their building.
Since, however, the building already covered nine acres, to add
even a single stone seemed superfluous. Could one mention furniture
in a peroration? Could one speak of chairs and tables and mats to
lie beside people’s beds? For whatever the peroration wanted, that
was what the house stood in need of. Leaving his speech unfinished
for the moment, he strode down hill again resolved henceforward to
devote himself to the furnishing of the mansion. The news — that
she was to attend him instantly — brought tears to the eyes of good
old Mrs Grimsditch, now grown somewhat old. Together they
perambulated the house.</p>
<p>The towel horse in the King’s bedroom (’and that was King Jamie,
my Lord,’ she said, hinting that it was many a day since a King had
slept under their roof; but the odious Parliament days were over
and there was now a Crown in England again) lacked a leg; there
were no stands to the ewers in the little closet leading into the
waiting room of the Duchess’s page; Mr Greene had made a stain on
the carpet with his nasty pipe smoking, which she and Judy, for all
their scrubbing, had never been able to wash out. Indeed, when
Orlando came to reckon up the matter of furnishing with rosewood
chairs and cedar-wood cabinets, with silver basins, china bowls,
and Persian carpets, every one of the three hundred and sixty-five
bedrooms which the house contained, he saw that it would be no
light one; and if some thousands of pounds of his estate remained
over, these would do little more than hang a few galleries with
tapestry, set the dining hall with fine, carved chairs and provide
mirrors of solid silver and chairs of the same metal (for which he
had an inordinate passion) for the furnishing of the royal
bedchambers.</p>
<p>He now set to work in earnest, as we can prove beyond a doubt if
we look at his ledgers. Let us glance at an inventory of what he
bought at this time, with the expenses totted up in the margin —
but these we omit.</p>
<p>‘To fifty pairs of Spanish blankets, ditto curtains of crimson
and white taffeta; the valence to them of white satin embroidered
with crimson and white silk…</p>
<p>‘To seventy yellow satin chairs and sixty stools, suitable with
their buckram covers to them all…</p>
<p>‘To sixty seven walnut tree tables…</p>
<p>‘To seventeen dozen boxes containing each dozen five dozen of
Venice glasses…</p>
<p>‘To one hundred and two mats, each thirty yards long…</p>
<p>‘To ninety seven cushions of crimson damask laid with silver
parchment lace and footstools of cloth of tissue and chairs
suitable…</p>
<p>‘To fifty branches for a dozen lights apiece… ’</p>
<p>Already — it is an effect lists have upon us — we are beginning
to yawn. But if we stop, it is only that the catalogue is tedious,
not that it is finished. There are ninety-nine pages more of it and
the total sum disbursed ran into many thousands — that is to say
millions of our money. And if his day was spent like this, at night
again, Lord Orlando might be found reckoning out what it would cost
to level a million molehills, if the men were paid tenpence an
hour; and again, how many hundredweight of nails at fivepence
halfpenny a gill were needed to repair the fence round the park,
which was fifteen miles in circumference. And so on and so on.</p>
<p>The tale, we say, is tedious, for one cupboard is much like
another, and one molehill not much different from a million. Some
pleasant journeys it cost him; and some fine adventures. As, for
instance, when he set a whole city of blind women near Bruges to
stitch hangings for a silver canopied bed; and the story of his
adventure with a Moor in Venice of whom he bought (but only at the
sword’s point) his lacquered cabinet, might, in other hands, prove
worth the telling. Nor did the work lack variety; for here would
come, drawn by teams from Sussex, great trees, to be sawn across
and laid along the gallery for flooring; and then a chest from
Persia, stuffed with wool and sawdust. from which, at last, he
would take a single plate, or one topaz ring.</p>
<p>At length, however, there was no room in the galleries for
another table; no room on the tables for another cabinet; no room
in the cabinet for another rose-bowl; no room in the bowl for
another handful of potpourri; there was no room for anything
anywhere; in short the house was furnished. In the garden
snowdrops, crocuses, hyacinths, magnolias, roses, lilies, asters,
the dahlia in all its varieties, pear trees and apple trees and
cherry trees and mulberry trees, with an enormous quantity of rare
and flowering shrubs, of trees evergreen and perennial, grew so
thick on each other’s roots that there was no plot of earth without
its bloom, and no stretch of sward without its shade. In addition,
he had imported wild fowl with gay plumage; and two Malay bears,
the surliness of whose manners concealed, he was certain, trusty
hearts.</p>
<p>All now was ready; and when it was evening and the innumerable
silver sconces were lit and the light airs which for ever moved
about the galleries stirred the blue and green arras, so that it
looked as if the huntsmen were riding and Daphne flying; when the
silver shone and lacquer glowed and wood kindled; when the carved
chairs held their arms out and dolphins swam upon the walls with
mermaids on their backs; when all this and much more than all this
was complete and to his liking, Orlando walked through the house
with his elk hounds following and felt content. He had matter now,
he thought, to fill out his peroration. Perhaps it would be well to
begin the speech all over again. Yet, as he paraded the galleries
he felt that still something was lacking. Chairs and tables,
however richly gilt and carved, sofas, resting on lions’ paws with
swans’ necks curving under them, beds even of the softest swansdown
are not by themselves enough. People sitting in them, people lying
in them improve them amazingly. Accordingly Orlando now began a
series of very splendid entertainments to the nobility and gentry
of the neighbourhood. The three hundred and sixty-five bedrooms
were full for a month at a time. Guests jostled each other on the
fifty-two staircases. Three hundred servants bustled about the
pantries. Banquets took place almost nightly. Thus, in a very few
years, Orlando had worn the nap off his velvet, and spent the half
of his fortune; but he had earned the good opinion of his
neighbours. held a score of offices in the county, and was annually
presented with perhaps a dozen volumes dedicated to his Lordship in
rather fulsome terms by grateful poets. For though he was careful
not to consort with writers at that time and kept himself always
aloof from ladies of foreign blood, still, he was excessively
generous both to women and to poets, and both adored him.</p>
<p>But when the feasting was at its height and his guests were at
their revels, he was apt to take himself off to his private room
alone. There when the door was shut, and he was certain of privacy,
he would have out an old writing book, stitched together with silk
stolen from his mother’s workbox, and labelled in a round schoolboy
hand, ‘The Oak Tree, A Poem’. In this he would write till midnight
chimed and long after. But as he scratched out as many lines as he
wrote in, the sum of them was often, at the end of the year, rather
less than at the beginning, and it looked as if in the process of
writing the poem would be completely unwritten. For it is for the
historian of letters to remark that he had changed his style
amazingly. His floridity was chastened; his abundance curbed; the
age of prose was congealing those warm fountains. The very
landscape outside was less stuck about with garlands and the briars
themselves were less thorned and intricate. Perhaps the senses were
a little duller and honey and cream less seductive to the palate.
Also that the streets were better drained and the houses better lit
had its effect upon the style, it cannot be doubted.</p>
<p>One day he was adding a line or two with enormous labour to ‘The
Oak Tree, A Poem’, when a shadow crossed the tail of his eye. It
was no shadow, he soon saw, but the figure of a very tall lady in
riding hood and mantle crossing the quadrangle on which his room
looked out. As this was the most private of the courts, and the
lady was a stranger to him, Orlando marvelled how she had got
there. Three days later the same apparition appeared again; and on
Wednesday noon appeared once more. This time, Orlando was
determined to follow her, nor apparently was she afraid to be
found, for she slackened her steps as he came up and looked him
full in the face. Any other woman thus caught in a Lord’s private
grounds would have been afraid; any other woman with that face,
head-dress, and aspect would have thrown her mantilla across her
shoulders to hide it. For this lady resembled nothing so much as a
hare; a hare startled, but obdurate; a hare whose timidity is
overcome by an immense and foolish audacity; a hare that sits
upright and glowers at its pursuer with great, bulging eyes; with
ears erect but quivering, with nose pointed, but twitching. This
hare, moreover, was six feet high and wore a head-dress into the
bargain of some antiquated kind which made her look still taller.
Thus confronted, she stared at Orlando with a stare in which
timidity and audacity were most strangely combined.</p>
<p>First, she asked him, with a proper, but somewhat clumsy
curtsey, to forgive her her intrusion. Then, rising to her full
height again, which must have been something over six feet two, she
went on to say — but with such a cackle of nervous laughter, so
much tee-heeing and haw-hawing that Orlando thought she must have
escaped from a lunatic asylum — that she was the Archduchess
Harriet Griselda of Finster-Aarhorn and Scand-op-Boom in the
Roumanian territory. She desired above all things to make his
acquaintance, she said. She had taken lodging over a baker’s shop
at the Park Gates. She had seen his picture and it was the image of
a sister of hers who was — here she guffawed — long since dead. She
was visiting the English court. The Queen was her Cousin. The King
was a very good fellow but seldom went to bed sober. Here she
tee-heed and haw-hawed again. In short, there was nothing for it
but to ask her in and give her a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Indoors, her manners regained the hauteur natural to a Roumanian
Archduchess; and had she not shown a knowledge of wines rare in a
lady, and made some observations upon firearms and the customs of
sportsmen in her country, which were sensible enough, the talk
would have lacked spontaneity. Jumping to her feet at last, she
announced that she would call the following day, swept another
prodigious curtsey and departed. The following day, Orlando rode
out. The next, he turned his back; on the third he drew his
curtain. On the fourth it rained, and as he could not keep a lady
in the wet, nor was altogether averse to company, he invited her in
and asked her opinion whether a suit of armour, which belonged to
an ancestor of his, was the work of Jacobi or of Topp. He inclined
to Topp. She held another opinion — it matters very little which.
But it is of some importance to the course of our story that, in
illustrating her argument, which had to do with the working of the
tie pieces, the Archduchess Harriet took the golden shin case and
fitted it to Orlando’s leg.</p>
<p>That he had a pair of the shapliest legs that any Nobleman has
ever stood upright upon has already been said.</p>
<p>Perhaps something in the way she fastened the ankle buckle; or
her stooping posture; or Orlando’s long seclusion; or the natural
sympathy which is between the sexes; or the Burgundy; or the fire —
any of these causes may have been to blame; for certainly blame
there is on one side or another, when a Nobleman of Orlando’s
breeding, entertaining a lady in his house, and she his elder by
many years, with a face a yard long and staring eyes, dressed
somewhat ridiculously too, in a mantle and riding cloak though the
season was warm — blame there is when such a Nobleman is so
suddenly and violently overcome by passion of some sort that he has
to leave the room.</p>
<p>But what sort of passion, it may well be asked, could this be?
And the answer is double faced as Love herself. For Love — but
leaving Love out of the argument for a moment, the actual event was
this:</p>
<p>When the Archduchess Harriet Griselda stooped to fasten the
buckle, Orlando heard, suddenly and unaccountably, far off the
beating of Love’s wings. The distant stir of that soft plumage
roused in him a thousand memories of rushing waters, of loveliness
in the snow and faithlessness in the flood; and the sound came
nearer; and he blushed and trembled; and he was moved as he had
thought never to be moved again; and he was ready to raise his
hands and let the bird of beauty alight upon his shoulders, when —
horror! — a creaking sound like that the crows make tumbling over
the trees began to reverberate; the air seemed dark with coarse
black wings; voices croaked; bits of straw, twigs, and feathers
dropped; and there pitched down upon his shoulders the heaviest and
foulest of the birds; which is the vulture. Thus he rushed from the
room and sent the footman to see the Archduchess Harriet to her
carriage.</p>
<p>For Love, to which we may now return, has two faces; one white,
the other black; two bodies; one smooth, the other hairy. It has
two hands, two feet, two nails, two, indeed, of every member and
each one is the exact opposite of the other. Yet, so strictly are
they joined together that you cannot separate them. In this case,
Orlando’s love began her flight towards him with her white face
turned, and her smooth and lovely body outwards. Nearer and nearer
she came wafting before her airs of pure delight. All of a sudden
(at the sight of the Archduchess presumably) she wheeled about,
turned the other way round; showed herself black, hairy, brutish;
and it was Lust the vulture, not Love, the Bird of Paradise, that
flopped, foully and disgustingly, upon his shoulders. Hence he ran;
hence he fetched the footman.</p>
<p>But the harpy is not so easily banished as all that. Not only
did the Archduchess continue to lodge at the Baker’s, but Orlando
was haunted every day and night by phantoms of the foulest kind.
Vainly, it seemed, had he furnished his house with silver and hung
the walls with arras, when at any moment a dung-bedraggled fowl
could settle upon his writing table. There she was, flopping about
among the chairs; he saw her waddling ungracefully across the
galleries. Now, she perched, top heavy upon a fire screen. When he
chased her out, back she came and pecked at the glass till she
broke it.</p>
<p>Thus realizing that his home was uninhabitable, and that steps
must be taken to end the matter instantly, he did what any other
young man would have done in his place, and asked King Charles to
send him as Ambassador Extraordinary to Constantinople. The King
was walking in Whitehall. Nell Gwyn was on his arm. She was pelting
him with hazel nuts. ‘Twas a thousand pities, that amorous lady
sighed, that such a pair of legs should leave the country.</p>
<p>Howbeit, the Fates were hard; she could do no more than toss one
kiss over her shoulder before Orlando sailed.</p>
