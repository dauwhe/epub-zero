<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
</div>


<p>Orlando went indoors. It was
completely still. It was very silent. There was the ink pot: there
was the pen; there was the manuscript of her poem, broken off in
the middle of a tribute to eternity. She had been about to say,
when Basket and Bartholomew interrupted with the tea things,
nothing changes. And then, in the space of three seconds and a
half, everything had changed — she had broken her ankle, fallen in
love, married Shelmerdine.</p>
<p>There was the wedding ring on her finger to prove it. It was
true that she had put it there herself before she met Shelmerdine,
but that had proved worse than useless. She now turned the ring
round and round, with superstitious reverence, taking care lest it
should slip past the joint of her finger.</p>
<p>‘The wedding ring has to be put on the third finger of the left
hand’, she said, like a child cautiously repeating its lesson, ‘for
it to be of any use at all.’</p>
<p>She spoke thus, aloud and rather more pompously than was her
wont, as if she wished someone whose good opinion she desired to
overhear her. Indeed, she had in mind, now that she was at last
able to collect her thoughts, the effect that her behaviour would
have had upon the spirit of the age. She was extremely anxious to
be informed whether the steps she had taken in the matter of
getting engaged to Shelmerdine and marrying him met with its
approval. She was certainly feeling more herself. Her finger had
not tingled once, or nothing to count, since that night on the
moor. Yet, she could not deny that she had her doubts. She was
married, true; but if one’s husband was always sailing round Cape
Horn, was it marriage? If one liked him, was it marriage? If one
liked other people, was it marriage? And finally, if one still
wished, more than anything in the whole world, to write poetry, was
it marriage? She had her doubts.</p>
<p>But she would put it to the test. She looked at the ring. She
looked at the ink pot. Did she dare? No, she did not. But she must.
No, she could not. What should she do then? Faint, if possible. But
she had never felt better in her life.</p>
<p>‘Hang it all!’ she cried, with a touch of her old spirit. ‘Here
goes!’</p>
<p>And she plunged her pen neck deep in the ink. To her enormous
surprise, there was no explosion. She drew the nib out. It was wet,
but not dripping. She wrote. The words were a little long in
coming, but come they did. Ah! but did they make sense? she
wondered, a panic coming over her lest the pen might have been at
some of its involuntary pranks again. She read,</p>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And then I came to a field where the springing grass</p>
<p>Was dulled by the hanging cups of fritillaries,</p>
<p>Sullen and foreign-looking, the snaky flower,</p>
<p>Scarfed in dull purple, like Egyptian girls:—</p>
</div>
<p>As she wrote she felt some power (remember we are dealing with
the most obscure manifestations of the human spirit) reading over
her shoulder, and when she had written ‘Egyptian girls’, the power
told her to stop. Grass, the power seemed to say, going back with a
ruler such as governesses use to the beginning, is all right; the
hanging cups of fritillaries — admirable; the snaky flower — a
thought, strong from a lady’s pen, perhaps, but Wordsworth no
doubt, sanctions it; but — girls? Are girls necessary? You have a
husband at the Cape, you say? Ah, well, that’ll do.</p>
<p>And so the spirit passed on.</p>
<p>Orlando now performed in spirit (for all this took place in
spirit) a deep obeisance to the spirit of her age, such as — to
compare great things with small — a traveller, conscious that he
has a bundle of cigars in the corner of his suit case, makes to the
customs officer who has obligingly made a scribble of white chalk
on the lid. For she was extremely doubtful whether, if the spirit
had examined the contents of her mind carefully, it would not have
found something highly contraband for which she would have had to
pay the full fine. She had only escaped by the skin of her teeth.
She had just managed, by some dexterous deference to the spirit of
the age, by putting on a ring and finding a man on a moor, by
loving nature and being no satirist, cynic, or psychologist — any
one of which goods would have been discovered at once — to pass its
examination successfully. And she heaved a deep sigh of relief, as,
indeed, well she might, for the transaction between a writer and
the spirit of the age is one of infinite delicacy, and upon a nice
arrangement between the two the whole fortune of his works depends.
Orlando had so ordered it that she was in an extremely happy
position; she need neither fight her age, nor submit to it; she was
of it, yet remained herself. Now, therefore, she could write, and
write she did. She wrote. She wrote. She wrote.</p>
<p>It was now November. After November, comes December. Then
January, February, March, and April. After April comes May. June,
July, August follow. Next is September. Then October, and so,
behold, here we are back at November again, with a whole year
accomplished.</p>
<p>This method of writing biography, though it has its merits, is a
little bare, perhaps, and the reader, if we go on with it, may
complain that he could recite the calendar for himself and so save
his pocket whatever sum the Hogarth Press may think proper to
charge for this book. But what can the biographer do when his
subject has put him in the predicament into which Orlando has now
put us? Life, it has been agreed by everyone whose opinion is worth
consulting, is the only fit subject for novelist or biographer;
life, the same authorities have decided, has nothing whatever to do
with sitting still in a chair and thinking. Thought and life are as
the poles asunder. Therefore — since sitting in a chair and
thinking is precisely what Orlando is doing now — there is nothing
for it but to recite the calendar, tell one’s beads, blow one’s
nose, stir the fire, look out of the window, until she has done.
Orlando sat so still that you could have heard a pin drop. Would,
indeed, that a pin had dropped! That would have been life of a
kind. Or if a butterfly had fluttered through the window and
settled on her chair, one could write about that. Or suppose she
had got up and killed a wasp. Then, at once, we could out with our
pens and write. For there would be blood shed, if only the blood of
a wasp. Where there is blood there is life. And if killing a wasp
is the merest trifle compared with killing a man, still it is a
fitter subject for novelist or biographer than this mere
wool-gathering; this thinking; this sitting in a chair day in, day
out, with a cigarette and a sheet of paper and a pen and an ink
pot. If only subjects, we might complain (for our patience is
wearing thin), had more consideration for their biographers! What
is more irritating than to see one’s subject, on whom one has
lavished so much time and trouble, slipping out of one’s grasp
altogether and indulging — witness her sighs and gasps, her
flushing, her palings, her eyes now bright as lamps, now haggard as
dawns — what is more humiliating than to see all this dumb show of
emotion and excitement gone through before our eyes when we know
that what causes it — thought and imagination — are of no
importance whatsoever?</p>
<p>But Orlando was a woman — Lord Palmerston had just proved it.
And when we are writing the life of a woman, we may, it is agreed,
waive our demand for action, and substitute love instead. Love, the
poet has said, is woman’s whole existence. And if we look for a
moment at Orlando writing at her table, we must admit that never
was there a woman more fitted for that calling. Surely, since she
is a woman, and a beautiful woman, and a woman in the prime of
life, she will soon give over this pretence of writing and thinking
and begin at least to think of a gamekeeper (and as long as she
thinks of a man, nobody objects to a woman thinking). And then she
will write him a little note (and as long as she writes little
notes nobody objects to a woman writing either) and make an
assignation for Sunday dusk and Sunday dusk will come; and the
gamekeeper will whistle under the window — all of which is, of
course, the very stuff of life and the only possible subject for
fiction. Surely Orlando must have done one of these things? Alas —
a thousand times, alas, Orlando did none of them. Must it then be
admitted that Orlando was one of those monsters of iniquity who do
not love? She was kind to dogs, faithful to friends, generosity
itself to a dozen starving poets, had a passion for poetry. But
love — as the male novelists define it — and who, after all, speak
with greater authority? — has nothing whatever to do with kindness,
fidelity, generosity, or poetry. Love is slipping off one’s
petticoat and — But we all know what love is. Did Orlando do that?
Truth compels us to say no, she did not. If then, the subject of
one’s biography will neither love nor kill, but will only think and
imagine, we may conclude that he or she is no better than a corpse
and so leave her.</p>
<p>The only resource now left us is to look out of the window.
There were sparrows; there were starlings; there were a number of
doves, and one or two rooks, all occupied after their fashion. One
finds a worm, another a snail. One flutters to a branch, another
takes a little run on the turf. Then a servant crosses the
courtyard, wearing a green baize apron. Presumably he is engaged on
some intrigue with one of the maids in the pantry, but as no
visible proof is offered us, in the courtyard, we can but hope for
the best and leave it. Clouds pass, thin or thick, with some
disturbance of the colour of the grass beneath. The sun-dial
registers the hour in its usual cryptic way. One’s mind begins
tossing up a question or two, idly, vainly, about this same life.
Life, it sings, or croons rather, like a kettle on a hob. Life,
life, what art thou? Light or darkness, the baize apron of the
under-footman or the shadow of the starling on the grass?</p>
<p>Let us go, then, exploring, this summer morning, when all are
adoring the plum blossom and the bee. And humming and hawing, let
us ask of the starling (who is a more sociable bird than the lark)
what he may think on the brink of the dustbin, whence he picks
among the sticks combings of scullion’s hair. What’s life, we ask,
leaning on the farmyard gate; Life, Life, Life! cries the bird, as
if he had heard, and knew precisely, what we meant by this
bothering prying habit of ours of asking questions indoors and out
and peeping and picking at daisies as the way is of writers when
they don’t know what to say next. Then they come here, says the
bird, and ask me what life is; Life, Life, Life!</p>
<p>We trudge on then by the moor path, to the high brow of the
wine-blue purple-dark hill, and fling ourselves down there, and
dream there and see there a grasshopper, carting back to his home
in the hollow, a straw. And he says (if sawings like his can be
given a name so sacred and tender) Life’s labour, or so we
interpret the whirr of his dust-choked gullet. And the ant agrees
and the bees, but if we lie here long enough to ask the moths, when
they come at evening, stealing among the paler heather bells, they
will breathe in our ears such wild nonsense as one hears from
telegraph wires in snow storms; tee hee, haw haw. Laughter,
Laughter! the moths say.</p>
<p>Having asked then of man and of bird and the insects, for fish,
men tell us, who have lived in green caves, solitary for years to
hear them speak, never, never say, and so perhaps know what life is
— having asked them all and grown no wiser, but only older and
colder (for did we not pray once in a way to wrap up in a book
something so hard, so rare, one could swear it was life’s meaning?)
back we must go and say straight out to the reader who waits
a-tiptoe to hear what life is — alas, we don’t know.</p>
<p>At this moment, but only just in time to save the book from
extinction, Orlando pushed away her chair, stretched her arms,
dropped her pen, came to the window, and exclaimed, ‘Done!’</p>
<p>She was almost felled to the ground by the extraordinary sight
which now met her eyes. There was the garden and some birds. The
world was going on as usual. All the time she was writing the world
had continued.</p>
<p>‘And if I were dead, it would be just the same!’ she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Such was the intensity of her feelings that she could even
imagine that she had suffered dissolution, and perhaps some
faintness actually attacked her. For a moment she stood looking at
the fair, indifferent spectacle with staring eyes. At length she
was revived in a singular way. The manuscript which reposed above
her heart began shuffling and beating as if it were a living thing,
and, what was still odder, and showed how fine a sympathy was
between them, Orlando, by inclining her head, could make out what
it was that it was saying. It wanted to be read. It must be read.
It would die in her bosom if it were not read. For the first time
in her life she turned with violence against nature. Elk-hounds and
rose bushes were about her in profusion. But elk-hounds and rose
bushes can none of them read. It is a lamentable oversight on the
part of Providence which had never struck her before. Human beings
alone are thus gifted. Human beings had become necessary. She rang
the bell. She ordered the carriage to take her to London at
once.</p>
<p>‘There’s just time to catch the eleven forty five, M’Lady,’ said
Basket. Orlando had not yet realized the invention of the steam
engine, but such was her absorption in the sufferings of a being,
who, though not herself, yet entirely depended on her, that she saw
a railway train for the first time, took her seat in a railway
carriage, and had the rug arranged about her knees without giving a
thought to ‘that stupendous invention, which had (the historians
say) completely changed the face of Europe in the past twenty
years’ (as, indeed, happens much more frequently than historians
suppose). She noticed only that it was extremely smutty; rattled
horribly; and the windows stuck. Lost in thought, she was whirled
up to London in something less than an hour and stood on the
platform at Charing Cross, not knowing where to go.</p>
<p>The old house at Blackfriars, where she had spent so many
pleasant days in the eighteenth century, was now sold, part to the
Salvation Army, part to an umbrella factory. She had bought another
in Mayfair which was sanitary, convenient, and in the heart of the
fashionable world, but was it in Mayfair that her poem would be
relieved of its desire? Pray God, she thought, remembering the
brightness of their ladyships’ eyes and the symmetry of their
lordship’s legs, they haven’t taken to reading there. For that
would be a thousand pities. Then there was Lady R.’s. The same sort
of talk would be going on there still, she had no doubt. The gout
might have shifted from the General’s left leg to his right,
perhaps. Mr L. might have stayed ten days with R. instead of T.
Then Mr Pope would come in. Oh! but Mr Pope was dead. Who were the
wits now, she wondered — but that was not a question one could put
to a porter, and so she moved on. Her ears were now distracted by
the jingling of innumerable bells on the heads of innumerable
horses. Fleets of the strangest little boxes on wheels were drawn
up by the pavement. She walked out into the Strand. There the
uproar was even worse. Vehicles of all sizes, drawn by blood horses
and by dray horses, conveying one solitary dowager or crowded to
the top by whiskered men in silk hats, were inextricably mixed.
Carriages, carts, and omnibuses seemed to her eyes, so long used to
the look of a plain sheet of foolscap, alarmingly at loggerheads;
and to her ears, attuned to a pen scratching, the uproar of the
street sounded violently and hideously cacophonous. Every inch of
the pavement was crowded. Streams of people, threading in and out
between their own bodies and the lurching and lumbering traffic
with incredible agility, poured incessantly east and west. Along
the edge of the pavement stood men, holding out trays of toys, and
bawled. At corners, women sat beside great baskets of spring
flowers and bawled. Boys running in and out of the horses’ noses,
holding printed sheets to their bodies, bawled too, Disaster!
Disaster! At first Orlando supposed that she had arrived at some
moment of national crisis; but whether it was happy or tragic, she
could not tell. She looked anxiously at people’s faces. But that
confused her still more. Here would come by a man sunk in despair,
muttering to himself as if he knew some terrible sorrow. Past him
would nudge a fat, jolly-faced fellow, shouldering his way along as
if it were a festival for all the world. Indeed, she came to the
conclusion that there was neither rhyme nor reason in any of it.
Each man and each woman was bent on his own affairs. And where was
she to go?</p>
<p>She walked on without thinking, up one street and down another,
by vast windows piled with handbags, and mirrors, and dressing
gowns, and flowers, and fishing rods, and luncheon baskets; while
stuff of every hue and pattern, thickness or thinness, was looped
and festooned and ballooned across and across. Sometimes she passed
down avenues of sedate mansions, soberly numbered ‘one’, ‘two’,
‘three’, and so on right up to two or three hundred, each the copy
of the other, with two pillars and six steps and a pair of curtains
neatly drawn and family luncheons laid on tables, and a parrot
looking out of one window and a man servant out of another, until
her mind was dizzied with the monotony. Then she came to great open
squares with black shiny, tightly buttoned statues of fat men in
the middle, and war horses prancing, and columns rising and
fountains falling and pigeons fluttering. So she walked and walked
along pavements between houses until she felt very hungry, and
something fluttering above her heart rebuked her with having
forgotten all about it. It was her manuscript. ‘The Oak Tree’.</p>
<p>She was confounded at her own neglect. She stopped dead where
she stood. No coach was in sight. The street, which was wide and
handsome, was singularly empty. Only one elderly gentleman was
approaching. There was something vaguely familiar to her in his
walk. As he came nearer, she felt certain that she had met him at
some time or other. But where? Could it be that this gentleman, so
neat, so portly, so prosperous, with a cane in his hand and a
flower in his button-hole, with a pink, plump face, and combed
white moustaches, could it be, Yes, by jove, it was! — her old, her
very old friend, Nick Greene!</p>
<p>At the same time he looked at her; remembered her; recognized
her. ‘The Lady Orlando!’ he cried, sweeping his silk hat almost in
the dust.</p>
<p>‘Sir Nicholas!’ she exclaimed. For she was made aware
intuitively by something in his bearing that the scurrilous
penny-a-liner, who had lampooned her and many another in the time
of Queen Elizabeth, was now risen in the world and become certainly
a Knight and doubtless a dozen other fine things into the
bargain.</p>
<p>With another bow, he acknowledged that her conclusion was
correct; he was a Knight; he was a Litt.D.; he was a Professor. He
was the author of a score of volumes. He was, in short, the most
influential critic of the Victorian age.</p>
<p>A violent tumult of emotion besieged her at meeting the man who
had caused her, years ago, so much pain. Could this be the plaguy,
restless fellow who had burnt holes in her carpets, and toasted
cheese in the Italian fireplace and told such merry stories of
Marlowe and the rest that they had seen the sun rise nine nights
out of ten? He was now sprucely dressed in a grey morning suit, had
a pink flower in his button-hole, and grey suede gloves to match.
But even as she marvelled, he made another bow, and asked her
whether she would honour him by lunching with him? The bow was a
thought overdone perhaps, but the imitation of fine breeding was
creditable. She followed him, wondering, into a superb restaurant,
all red plush, white table-cloths, and silver cruets, as unlike as
could be the old tavern or coffee house with its sanded floor, its
wooden benches, its bowls of punch and chocolate, and its
broadsheets and spittoons. He laid his gloves neatly on the table
beside him. Still she could hardly believe that he was the same
man. His nails were clean; where they used to be an inch long. His
chin was shaved; where a black beard used to sprout. He wore gold
sleeve-links; where his ragged linen used to dip in the broth. It
was not, indeed, until he had ordered the wine, which he did with a
care that reminded her of his taste in Malmsey long ago, that she
was convinced he was the same man. ‘Ah!’ he said, heaving a little
sigh, which was yet comfortable enough, ‘ah! my dear lady, the
great days of literature are over. Marlowe, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson
— those were the giants. Dryden, Pope, Addison — those were the
heroes. All, all are dead now. And whom have they left us?
Tennyson, Browning, Carlyle!’— he threw an immense amount of scorn
into his voice. ‘The truth of it is,’ he said, pouring himself a
glass of wine, ‘that all our young writers are in the pay of the
booksellers. They turn out any trash that serves to pay their
tailor’s bills. It is an age’, he said, helping himself to
hors-d’oeuvres, ‘marked by precious conceits and wild experiments —
none of which the Elizabethans would have tolerated for an
instant.’</p>
<p>‘No, my dear lady,’ he continued, passing with approval the
turbot au gratin, which the waiter exhibited for his sanction, ‘the
great days are over. We live in degenerate times. We must cherish
the past; honour those writers — there are still a few left of ‘em
— who take antiquity for their model and write, not for pay but —’
Here Orlando almost shouted ‘Glawr!’ Indeed she could have sworn
that she had heard him say the very same things three hundred years
ago. The names were different, of course, but the spirit was the
same. Nick Greene had not changed, for all his knighthood. And yet,
some change there was. For while he ran on about taking Addison as
one’s model (it had been Cicero once, she thought) and lying in bed
of a morning (which she was proud to think her pension paid
quarterly enabled him to do) rolling the best works of the best
authors round and round on one’s tongue for an hour, at least,
before setting pen to paper, so that the vulgarity of the present
time and the deplorable condition of our native tongue (he had
lived long in America, she believed) might be purified — while he
ran on in much the same way that Greene had run on three hundred
years ago, she had time to ask herself, how was it then that he had
changed? He had grown plump; but he was a man verging on seventy.
He had grown sleek: literature had been a prosperous pursuit
evidently; but somehow the old restless, uneasy vivacity had gone.
His stories, brilliant as they were, were no longer quite so free
and easy. He mentioned, it is true, ‘my dear friend Pope’ or ‘my
illustrious friend Addison’ every other second, but he had an air
of respectability about him which was depressing, and he preferred,
it seemed, to enlighten her about the doings and sayings of her own
blood relations rather than tell her, as he used to do, scandal
about the poets.</p>
<p>Orlando was unaccountably disappointed. She had thought of
literature all these years (her seclusion, her rank, her sex must
be her excuse) as something wild as the wind, hot as fire, swift as
lightning; something errant, incalculable, abrupt, and behold,
literature was an elderly gentleman in a grey suit talking about
duchesses. The violence of her disillusionment was such that some
hook or button fastening the upper part of her dress burst open,
and out upon the table fell ‘The Oak Tree’, a poem.</p>
<p>‘A manuscript!’ said Sir Nicholas, putting on his gold
pince-nez. ‘How interesting, how excessively interesting! Permit me
to look at it.’ And once more, after an interval of some three
hundred years, Nicholas Greene took Orlando’s poem and, laying it
down among the coffee cups and the liqueur glasses, began to read
it. But now his verdict was very different from what it had been
then. It reminded him, he said as he turned over the pages, of
Addison’s “Cato”. It compared favourably with Thomson’s “Seasons”.
There was no trace in it, he was thankful to say, of the modern
spirit. It was composed with a regard to truth, to nature, to the
dictates of the human heart, which was rare indeed, in these days
of unscrupulous eccentricity. It must, of course, be published
instantly.</p>
<p>Really Orlando did not know what he meant. She had always
carried her manuscripts about with her in the bosom of her dress.
The idea tickled Sir Nicholas considerably.</p>
<p>‘But what about royalties?’ he asked.</p>
<p>Orlando’s mind flew to Buckingham Palace and some dusky
potentates who happened to be staying there.</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas was highly diverted. He explained that he was
alluding to the fact that Messrs — (here he mentioned a well-known
firm of publishers) would be delighted, if he wrote them a line, to
put the book on their list. He could probably arrange for a royalty
of ten per cent on all copies up to two thousand; after that it
would be fifteen. As for the reviewers, he would himself write a
line to Mr — who was the most influential; then a compliment — say
a little puff of her own poems — addressed to the wife of the
editor of the — never did any harm. He would call —. So he ran on.
Orlando understood nothing of all this, and from old experience did
not altogether trust his good nature, but there was nothing for it
but to submit to what was evidently his wish and the fervent desire
of the poem itself. So Sir Nicholas made the blood-stained packet
into a neat parcel; flattened it into his breast pocket, lest it
should disturb the set of his coat; and with many compliments on
both sides, they parted.</p>
<p>Orlando walked up the street. Now that the poem was gone — and
she felt a bare place in her breast where she had been used to
carry it — she had nothing to do but reflect upon whatever she
liked — the extraordinary chances it might be of the human lot.
Here she was in St James’s Street; a married woman; with a ring on
her finger; where there had been a coffee house once there was now
a restaurant; it was about half past three in the afternoon; the
sun was shining; there were three pigeons; a mongrel terrier dog;
two hansom cabs and a barouche landau. What then, was Life? The
thought popped into her head violently, irrelevantly (unless old
Greene were somehow the cause of it). And it may be taken as a
comment, adverse or favourable, as the reader chooses to consider
it upon her relations with her husband (who was at the Horn), that
whenever anything popped violently into her head, she went straight
to the nearest telegraph office and wired to him. There was one, as
it happened, close at hand. ‘My God Shel’, she wired; ‘life
literature Greene toady —’ here she dropped into a cypher language
which they had invented between them so that a whole spiritual
state of the utmost complexity might be conveyed in a word or two
without the telegraph clerk being any wiser, and added the words
‘Rattigan Glumphoboo’, which summed it up precisely. For not only
had the events of the morning made a deep impression on her, but it
cannot have escaped the reader’s attention that Orlando was growing
up — which is not necessarily growing better — and ‘Rattigan
Glumphoboo’ described a very complicated spiritual state — which if
the reader puts all his intelligence at our service he may discover
for himself.</p>
<p>There could be no answer to her telegram for some hours; indeed,
it was probable, she thought, glancing at the sky, where the upper
clouds raced swiftly past, that there was a gale at Cape Horn, so
that her husband would be at the mast-head, as likely as not, or
cutting away some tattered spar, or even alone in a boat with a
biscuit. And so, leaving the post office, she turned to beguile
herself into the next shop, which was a shop so common in our day
that it needs no description, yet, to her eyes, strange in the
extreme; a shop where they sold books. All her life long Orlando
had known manuscripts; she had held in her hands the rough brown
sheets on which Spenser had written in his little crabbed hand; she
had seen Shakespeare’s script and Milton’s. She owned, indeed, a
fair number of quartos and folios, often with a sonnet in her
praise in them and sometimes a lock of hair. But these innumerable
little volumes, bright, identical, ephemeral, for they seemed bound
in cardboard and printed on tissue paper, surprised her infinitely.
The whole works of Shakespeare cost half a crown, and could be put
in your pocket. One could hardly read them, indeed, the print was
so small, but it was a marvel, none the less. ‘Works’— the works of
every writer she had known or heard of and many more stretched from
end to end of the long shelves. On tables and chairs, more ‘works’
were piled and tumbled, and these she saw, turning a page or two,
were often works about other works by Sir Nicholas and a score of
others whom, in her ignorance, she supposed, since they were bound
and printed, to be very great writers too. So she gave an
astounding order to the bookseller to send her everything of any
importance in the shop and left.</p>
<p>She turned into Hyde Park, which she had known of old (beneath
that cleft tree, she remembered, the Duke of Hamilton fell run
through the body by Lord Mohun), and her lips, which are often to
blame in the matter, began framing the words of her telegram into a
senseless singsong; life literature Greene toady Rattigan
Glumphoboo; so that several park keepers looked at her with
suspicion and were only brought to a favourable opinion of her
sanity by noticing the pearl necklace which she wore. She had
carried off a sheaf of papers and critical journals from the book
shop, and at length, flinging herself on her elbow beneath a tree,
she spread these pages round her and did her best to fathom the
noble art of prose composition as these masters practised it. For
still the old credulity was alive in her; even the blurred type of
a weekly newspaper had some sanctity in her eyes. So she read,
lying on her elbow, an article by Sir Nicholas on the collected
works of a man she had once known — John Donne. But she had pitched
herself, without knowing it, not far from the Serpentine. The
barking of a thousand dogs sounded in her ears. Carriage wheels
rushed ceaselessly in a circle. Leaves sighed overhead. Now and
again a braided skirt and a pair of tight scarlet trousers crossed
the grass within a few steps of her. Once a gigantic rubber ball
bounced on the newspaper. Violets, oranges, reds, and blues broke
through the interstices of the leaves and sparkled in the emerald
on her finger. She read a sentence and looked up at the sky; she
looked up at the sky and looked down at the newspaper. Life?
Literature? One to be made into the other? But how monstrously
difficult! For — here came by a pair of tight scarlet trousers —
how would Addison have put that? Here came two dogs dancing on
their hind legs. How would Lamb have described that? For reading
Sir Nicholas and his friends (as she did in the intervals of
looking about her), she somehow got the impression — here she rose
and walked — they made one feel — it was an extremely uncomfortable
feeling — one must never, never say what one thought. (She stood on
the banks of the Serpentine. It was a bronze colour; spider-thin
boats were skimming from side to side.) They made one feel, she
continued, that one must always, always write like somebody else.
(The tears formed themselves in her eyes.) For really, she thought,
pushing a little boat off with her toe, I don’t think I could (here
the whole of Sir Nicholas’ article came before her as articles do,
ten minutes after they are read, with the look of his room, his
head, his cat, his writing-table, and the time of the day thrown
in), I don’t think I could, she continued, considering the article
from this point of view, sit in a study, no, it’s not a study, it’s
a mouldy kind of drawing-room, all day long, and talk to pretty
young men, and tell them little anecdotes, which they mustn’t
repeat, about what Tupper said about Smiles; and then, she
continued, weeping bitterly, they’re all so manly; and then, I do
detest Duchesses; and I don’t like cake; and though I’m spiteful
enough, I could never learn to be as spiteful as all that, so how
can I be a critic and write the best English prose of my time? Damn
it all! she exclaimed, launching a penny steamer so vigorously that
the poor little boat almost sank in the bronze-coloured waves.</p>
<p>Now, the truth is that when one has been in a state of mind (as
nurses call it)— and the tears still stood in Orlando’s eyes — the
thing one is looking at becomes, not itself, but another thing,
which is bigger and much more important and yet remains the same
thing. If one looks at the Serpentine in this state of mind, the
waves soon become just as big as the waves on the Atlantic; the toy
boats become indistinguishable from ocean liners. So Orlando
mistook the toy boat for her husband’s brig; and the wave she had
made with her toe for a mountain of water off Cape Horn; and as she
watched the toy boat climb the ripple, she thought she saw
Bonthrop’s ship climb up and up a glassy wall; up and up it went,
and a white crest with a thousand deaths in it arched over it; and
through the thousand deaths it went and disappeared —’It’s sunk!’
she cried out in an agony — and then, behold, there it was again
sailing along safe and sound among the ducks on the other side of
the Atlantic.</p>
<p>‘Ecstasy!’ she cried. ‘Ecstasy! Where’s the post office?’ she
wondered. ‘For I must wire at once to Shel and tell him… ’ And
repeating ‘A toy boat on the Serpentine’, and ‘Ecstasy’,
alternately, for the thoughts were interchangeable and meant
exactly the same thing, she hurried towards Park Lane.</p>
<p>‘A toy boat, a toy boat, a toy boat,’ she repeated, thus
enforcing upon herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick
Greene on John Donne nor eight-hour bills nor covenants nor factory
acts that matter; it’s something useless, sudden, violent;
something that costs a life; red, blue, purple; a spirit; a splash;
like those hyacinths (she was passing a fine bed of them); free
from taint, dependence, soilure of humanity or care for one’s kind;
something rash, ridiculous, like my hyacinth, husband I mean,
Bonthrop: that’s what it is — a toy boat on the Serpentine, ecstasy
— it’s ecstasy that matters. Thus she spoke aloud, waiting for the
carriages to pass at Stanhope Gate, for the consequence of not
living with one’s husband, except when the wind is sunk, is that
one talks nonsense aloud in Park Lane. It would no doubt have been
different had she lived all the year round with him as Queen
Victoria recommended. As it was the thought of him would come upon
her in a flash. She found it absolutely necessary to speak to him
instantly. She did not care in the least what nonsense it might
make, or what dislocation it might inflict on the narrative. Nick
Greene’s article had plunged her in the depths of despair; the toy
boat had raised her to the heights of joy. So she repeated:
‘Ecstasy, ecstasy’, as she stood waiting to cross.</p>
<p>But the traffic was heavy that spring afternoon, and kept her
standing there, repeating, ecstasy, ecstasy, or a toy boat on the
Serpentine, while the wealth and power of England sat, as if
sculptured, in hat and cloak, in four-in-hand, victoria and
barouche landau. It was as if a golden river had coagulated and
massed itself in golden blocks across Park Lane. The ladies held
card-cases between their fingers; the gentlemen balanced
gold-mounted canes between their knees. She stood there gazing,
admiring, awe-struck. One thought only disturbed her, a thought
familiar to all who behold great elephants, or whales of an
incredible magnitude, and that is: how do these leviathans to whom
obviously stress, change, and activity are repugnant, propagate
their kind? Perhaps, Orlando thought, looking at the stately, still
faces, their time of propagation is over; this is the fruit; this
is the consummation. What she now beheld was the triumph of an age.
Portly and splendid there they sat. But now, the policeman let fall
his hand; the stream became liquid; the massive conglomeration of
splendid objects moved, dispersed, and disappeared into
Piccadilly.</p>
<p>So she crossed Park Lane and went to her house in Curzon Street,
where, when the meadow-sweet blew there, she could remember curlew
calling and one very old man with a gun.</p>
<p>She could remember, she thought, stepping across the threshold
of her house, how Lord Chesterfield had said — but her memory was
checked. Her discreet eighteenth-century hall, where she could see
Lord Chesterfield putting his hat down here and his coat down there
with an elegance of deportment which it was a pleasure to watch,
was now completely littered with parcels. While she had been
sitting in Hyde Park the bookseller had delivered her order, and
the house was crammed — there were parcels slipping down the
staircase — with the whole of Victorian literature done up in grey
paper and neatly tied with string. She carried as many of these
packets as she could to her room, ordered footmen to bring the
others, and, rapidly cutting innumerable strings, was soon
surrounded by innumerable volumes.</p>
<p>Accustomed to the little literatures of the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, Orlando was appalled by the
consequences of her order. For, of course, to the Victorians
themselves Victorian literature meant not merely four great names
separate and distinct but four great names sunk and embedded in a
mass of Alexander Smiths, Dixons, Blacks, Milmans, Buckles, Taines,
Paynes, Tuppers, Jamesons — all vocal, clamorous, prominent, and
requiring as much attention as anybody else. Orlando’s reverence
for print had a tough job set before it but drawing her chair to
the window to get the benefit of what light might filter between
the high houses of Mayfair, she tried to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>And now it was clear that there are only two ways of coming to a
conclusion upon Victorian literature — one is to write it out in
sixty volumes octavo, the other is to squeeze it into six lines of
the length of this one. Of the two courses, economy, since time
runs short, leads us to choose the second; and so we proceed.
Orlando then came to the conclusion (opening half-a-dozen books)
that it was very odd that there was not a single dedication to a
nobleman among them; next (turning over a vast pile of memoirs)
that several of these writers had family trees half as high as her
own; next, that it would be impolitic in the extreme to wrap a
ten-pound note round the sugar tongs when Miss Christina Rossetti
came to tea; next (here were half-a-dozen invitations to celebrate
centenaries by dining) that literature since it ate all these
dinners must be growing very corpulent; next (she was invited to a
score of lectures on the Influence of this upon that; the Classical
revival; the Romantic survival, and other titles of the same
engaging kind) that literature since it listened to all these
lectures must be growing very dry; next (here she attended a
reception given by a peeress) that literature since it wore all
those fur tippets must be growing very respectable; next (here she
visited Carlyle’s sound-proof room at Chelsea) that genius since it
needed all this coddling must be growing very delicate; and so at
last she reached her final conclusion, which was of the highest
importance but which, as we have already much overpassed our limit
of six lines, we must omit.</p>
<p>Orlando, having come to this conclusion, stood looking out of
the window for a considerable space of time. For, when anybody
comes to a conclusion it is as if they had tossed the ball over the
net and must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them.
What would be sent her next from the colourless sky above
Chesterfield House, she wondered? And with her hands clasped, she
stood for a considerable space of time wondering. Suddenly she
started — and here we could only wish that, as on a former
occasion, Purity, Chastity, and Modesty would push the door ajar
and provide, at least, a breathing space in which we could think
how to wrap up what now has to be told delicately, as a biographer
should. But no! Having thrown their white garment at the naked
Orlando and seen it fall short by several inches, these ladies had
given up all intercourse with her these many years; and were now
otherwise engaged. Is nothing then, going to happen this pale March
morning to mitigate, to veil, to cover, to conceal, to shroud this
undeniable event whatever it may be? For after giving that sudden,
violent start, Orlando — but Heaven be praised, at this very moment
there struck up outside one of these frail, reedy, fluty, jerky,
old-fashioned barrel-organs which are still sometimes played by
Italian organ-grinders in back streets. Let us accept the
intervention, humble though it is, as if it were the music of the
spheres, and allow it, with all its gasps and groans, to fill this
page with sound until the moment comes when it is impossible to
deny its coming; which the footman has seen coming and the
maid-servant; and the reader will have to see too; for Orlando
herself is clearly unable to ignore it any longer — let the
barrel-organ sound and transport us on thought, which is no more
than a little boat, when music sounds, tossing on the waves; on
thought, which is, of all carriers, the most clumsy, the most
erratic, over the roof tops and the back gardens where washing is
hanging to — what is this place? Do you recognize the Green and in
the middle the steeple, and the gate with a lion couchant on either
side? Oh yes, it is Kew! Well, Kew will do. So here we are at Kew,
and I will show you to-day (the second of March) under the plum
tree, a grape hyacinth, and a crocus, and a bud, too, on the almond
tree; so that to walk there is to be thinking of bulbs, hairy and
red, thrust into the earth in October; flowering now; and to be
dreaming of more than can rightly be said, and to be taking from
its case a cigarette or cigar even, and to be flinging a cloak
under (as the rhyme requires) an oak, and there to sit, waiting the
kingfisher, which, it is said, was seen once to cross in the
evening from bank to bank.</p>
<p>Wait! Wait! The kingfisher comes; the kingfisher comes not.</p>
<p>Behold, meanwhile, the factory chimneys and their smoke; behold
the city clerks flashing by in their outrigger. Behold the old lady
taking her dog for a walk and the servant girl wearing her new hat
for the first time not at the right angle. Behold them all. Though
Heaven has mercifully decreed that the secrets of all hearts are
hidden so that we are lured on for ever to suspect something,
perhaps, that does not exist; still through our cigarette smoke, we
see blaze up and salute the splendid fulfilment of natural desires
for a hat, for a boat, for a rat in a ditch; as once one saw
blazing — such silly hops and skips the mind takes when it slops
like this all over the saucer and the barrel-organ plays — saw
blazing a fire in a field against minarets near Constantinople.</p>
<p>Hail! natural desire! Hail! happiness! divine happiness! and
pleasure of all sorts, flowers and wine, though one fades and the
other intoxicates; and half-crown tickets out of London on Sundays,
and singing in a dark chapel hymns about death, and anything,
anything that interrupts and confounds the tapping of typewriters
and filing of letters and forging of links and chains, binding the
Empire together. Hail even the crude, red bows on shop girls’ lips
(as if Cupid, very clumsily, dipped his thumb in red ink and
scrawled a token in passing). Hail, happiness! kingfisher flashing
from bank to bank, and all fulfilment of natural desire, whether it
is what the male novelist says it is; or prayer; or denial; hail!
in whatever form it comes, and may there be more forms, and
stranger. For dark flows the stream — would it were true, as the
rhyme hints ‘like a dream’— but duller and worser than that is our
usual lot; without dreams, but alive, smug, fluent, habitual, under
trees whose shade of an olive green drowns the blue of the wing of
the vanishing bird when he darts of a sudden from bank to bank.</p>
<p>Hail, happiness, then, and after happiness, hail not those
dreams which bloat the sharp image as spotted mirrors do the face
in a country-inn parlour; dreams which splinter the whole and tear
us asunder and wound us and split us apart in the night when we
would sleep; but sleep, sleep, so deep that all shapes are ground
to dust of infinite softness, water of dimness inscrutable, and
there, folded, shrouded, like a mummy, like a moth, prone let us
lie on the sand at the bottom of sleep.</p>
<p>But wait! but wait! we are not going, this time, visiting the
blind land. Blue, like a match struck right in the ball of the
innermost eye, he flies, burns, bursts the seal of sleep; the
kingfisher; so that now floods back refluent like a tide, the red,
thick stream of life again; bubbling, dripping; and we rise, and
our eyes (for how handy a rhyme is to pass us safe over the awkward
transition from death to life) fall on —(here the barrel-organ
stops playing abruptly).</p>
<p>‘It’s a very fine boy, M’Lady,’ said Mrs Banting, the midwife,
putting her first-born child into Orlando’s arms. In other words
Orlando was safely delivered of a son on Thursday, March the 20th,
at three o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Once more Orlando stood at the window, but let the reader take
courage; nothing of the same sort is going to happen to-day, which
is not, by any means, the same day. No — for if we look out of the
window, as Orlando was doing at the moment, we shall see that Park
Lane itself has considerably changed. Indeed one might stand there
ten minutes or more, as Orlando stood now, without seeing a single
barouche landau. ‘Look at that!’ she exclaimed, some days later
when an absurd truncated carriage without any horses began to glide
about of its own accord. A carriage without any horses indeed! She
was called away just as she said that, but came back again after a
time and had another look out of the window. It was odd sort of
weather nowadays. The sky itself, she could not help thinking, had
changed. It was no longer so thick, so watery, so prismatic now
that King Edward — see, there he was, stepping out of his neat
brougham to go and visit a certain lady opposite — had succeeded
Queen Victoria. The clouds had shrunk to a thin gauze; the sky
seemed made of metal, which in hot weather tarnished verdigris,
copper colour or orange as metal does in a fog. It was a little
alarming — this shrinkage. Everything seemed to have shrunk.
Driving past Buckingham Palace last night, there was not a trace of
that vast erection which she had thought everlasting; top hats,
widows’ weeds, trumpets, telescopes, wreaths, all had vanished and
left not a stain, not a puddle even, on the pavement. But it was
now — after another interval she had come back again to her
favourite station in the window — now, in the evening, that the
change was most remarkable. Look at the lights in the houses! At a
touch, a whole room was lit; hundreds of rooms were lit; and one
was precisely the same as the other. One could see everything in
the little square-shaped boxes; there was no privacy; none of those
lingering shadows and odd corners that there used to be; none of
those women in aprons carrying wobbly lamps which they put down
carefully on this table and on that. At a touch, the whole room was
bright. And the sky was bright all night long; and the pavements
were bright; everything was bright. She came back again at mid-day.
How narrow women have grown lately! They looked like stalks of
corn, straight, shining, identical. And men’s faces were as bare as
the palm of one’s hand. The dryness of the atmosphere brought out
the colour in everything and seemed to stiffen the muscles of the
cheeks. It was harder to cry now. Water was hot in two seconds. Ivy
had perished or been scraped off houses. Vegetables were less
fertile; families were much smaller. Curtains and covers had been
frizzled up and the walls were bare so that new brilliantly
coloured pictures of real things like streets, umbrellas, apples,
were hung in frames, or painted upon the wood. There was something
definite and distinct about the age, which reminded her of the
eighteenth century, except that there was a distraction, a
desperation — as she was thinking this, the immensely long tunnel
in which she seemed to have been travelling for hundreds of years
widened; the light poured in; her thoughts became mysteriously
tightened and strung up as if a piano tuner had put his key in her
back and stretched the nerves very taut; at the same time her
hearing quickened; she could hear every whisper and crackle in the
room so that the clock ticking on the mantelpiece beat like a
hammer. And so for some seconds the light went on becoming brighter
and brighter, and she saw everything more and more clearly and the
clock ticked louder and louder until there was a terrific explosion
right in her ear. Orlando leapt as if she had been violently struck
on the head. Ten times she was struck. In fact it was ten o’clock
in the morning. It was the eleventh of October. It was 1928. It was
the present moment.</p>
<p>No one need wonder that Orlando started, pressed her hand to her
heart, and turned pale. For what more terrifying revelation can
there be than that it is the present moment? That we survive the
shock at all is only possible because the past shelters us on one
side and the future on another. But we have no time now for
reflections; Orlando was terribly late already. She ran downstairs,
she jumped into her motorcar, she pressed the self-starter and was
off. Vast blue blocks of building rose into the air; the red cowls
of chimneys were spotted irregularly across the sky; the road shone
like silver-headed nails; omnibuses bore down upon her with
sculptured white-faced drivers; she noticed sponges, bird-cages,
boxes of green American cloth. But she did not allow these sights
to sink into her mind even the fraction of an inch as she crossed
the narrow plank of the present, lest she should fall into the
raging torrent beneath. ‘Why don’t you look where you’re going to?…
Put your hand out, can’t you?’— that was all she said sharply, as
if the words were jerked out of her. For the streets were immensely
crowded; people crossed without looking where they were going.
People buzzed and hummed round the plate-glass windows within which
one could see a glow of red, a blaze of yellow, as if they were
bees, Orlando thought — but her thought that they were bees was
violently snipped off and she saw, regaining perspective with one
flick of her eye, that they were bodies. ‘Why don’t you look where
you’re going?’ she snapped out.</p>
<p>At last, however, she drew up at Marshall &amp; Snelgrove’s and
went into the shop. Shade and scent enveloped her. The present fell
from her like drops of scalding water. Light swayed up and down
like thin stuffs puffed out by a summer breeze. She took a list
from her bag and began reading in a curious stiff voice at first,
as if she were holding the words — boy’s boots, bath salts,
sardines — under a tap of many-coloured water. She watched them
change as the light fell on them. Bath and boots became blunt,
obtuse; sardines serrated itself like a saw. So she stood in the
ground-floor department of Messrs Marshall &amp; Snelgrove; looked
this way and that; snuffed this smell and that and thus wasted some
seconds. Then she got into the lift, for the good reason that the
door stood open; and was shot smoothly upwards. The very fabric of
life now, she thought as she rose, is magic. In the eighteenth
century we knew how everything was done; but here I rise through
the air; I listen to voices in America; I see men flying — but how
its done I can’t even begin to wonder. So my belief in magic
returns. Now the lift gave a little jerk as it stopped at the first
floor; and she had a vision of innumerable coloured stuffs
flaunting in a breeze from which came distinct, strange smells; and
each time the lift stopped and flung its doors open, there was
another slice of the world displayed with all the smells of that
world clinging to it. She was reminded of the river off Wapping in
the time of Elizabeth, where the treasure ships and the merchant
ships used to anchor. How richly and curiously they had smelt! How
well she remembered the feel of rough rubies running through her
fingers when she dabbled them in a treasure sack! And then lying
with Sukey — or whatever her name was — and having Cumberland’s
lantern flashed on them! The Cumberlands had a house in Portland
Place now and she had lunched with them the other day and ventured
a little joke with the old man about almshouses in the Sheen Road.
He had winked. But here as the lift could go no higher, she must
get out — Heaven knows into what ‘department’ as they called it.
She stood still to consult her shopping list, but was blessed if
she could see, as the list bade her, bath salts, or boy’s boots
anywhere about. And indeed, she was about to descend again, without
buying anything, but was saved from that outrage by saying aloud
automatically the last item on her list; which happened to be
‘sheets for a double bed’.</p>
<p>‘Sheets for a double bed,’ she said to a man at a counter and,
by a dispensation of Providence, it was sheets that the man at that
particular counter happened to sell. For Grimsditch, no, Grimsditch
was dead; Bartholomew, no, Bartholomew was dead; Louise then —
Louise had come to her in a great taking the other day, for she had
found a hole in the bottom of the sheet in the royal bed. Many
kings and queens had slept there — Elizabeth; James; Charles;
George; Victoria; Edward; no wonder the sheet had a hole in it. But
Louise was positive she knew who had done it. It was the Prince
Consort.</p>
<p>‘Sale bosch!’ she said (for there had been another war; this
time against the Germans).</p>
<p>‘Sheets for a double bed,’ Orlando repeated dreamily, for a
double bed with a silver counterpane in a room fitted in a taste
which she now thought perhaps a little vulgar — all in silver; but
she had furnished it when she had a passion for that metal. While
the man went to get sheets for a double bed, she took out a little
looking-glass and a powder puff. Women were not nearly as
roundabout in their ways, she thought, powdering herself with the
greatest unconcern, as they had been when she herself first turned
woman and lay on the deck of the “Enamoured Lady”. She gave her
nose the right tint deliberately. She never touched her cheeks.
Honestly, though she was now thirty-six, she scarcely looked a day
older. She looked just as pouting, as sulky, as handsome, as rosy
(like a million-candled Christmas tree, Sasha had said) as she had
done that day on the ice, when the Thames was frozen and they had
gone skating&#160;—</p>
<p>‘The best Irish linen, Ma’am,’ said the shopman, spreading the
sheets on the counter — and they had met an old woman picking up
sticks. Here, as she was fingering the linen abstractedly, one of
the swing-doors between the departments opened and let through,
perhaps from the fancy-goods department, a whiff of scent, waxen,
tinted as if from pink candles, and the scent curved like a shell
round a figure — was it a boy’s or was it a girl’s — young,
slender, seductive — a girl, by God! furred, pearled, in Russian
trousers; but faithless, faithless!</p>
<p>‘Faithless!’ cried Orlando (the man had gone) and all the shop
seemed to pitch and toss with yellow water and far off she saw the
masts of the Russian ship standing out to sea, and then,
miraculously (perhaps the door opened again) the conch which the
scent had made became a platform, a dais, off which stepped a fat,
furred woman, marvellously well preserved, seductive, diademed, a
Grand Duke’s mistress; she who, leaning over the banks of the
Volga, eating sandwiches, had watched men drown; and began walking
down the shop towards her.</p>
<p>‘Oh Sasha!’ Orlando cried. Really, she was shocked that she
should have come to this; she had grown so fat; so lethargic; and
she bowed her head over the linen so that this apparition of a grey
woman in fur, and a girl in Russian trousers, with all these smells
of wax candles, white flowers, and old ships that it brought with
it might pass behind her back unseen.</p>
<p>‘Any napkins, towels, dusters today, Ma’am?’ the shopman
persisted. And it is enormously to the credit of the shopping list,
which Orlando now consulted, that she was able to reply with every
appearance of composure, that there was only one thing in the world
she wanted and that was bath salts; which was in another
department.</p>
<p>But descending in the lift again — so insidious is the
repetition of any scene — she was again sunk far beneath the
present moment; and thought when the lift bumped on the ground,
that she heard a pot broken against a river bank. As for finding
the right department, whatever it might be, she stood engrossed
among the handbags, deaf to the suggestions of all the polite,
black, combed, sprightly shop assistants, who descending as they
did equally and some of them, perhaps, as proudly, even from such
depths of the past as she did, chose to let down the impervious
screen of the present so that today they appeared shop assistants
in Marshall &amp; Snelgrove’s merely. Orlando stood there
hesitating. Through the great glass doors she could see the traffic
in Oxford Street. Omnibus seemed to pile itself upon omnibus and
then to jerk itself apart. So the ice blocks had pitched and tossed
that day on the Thames. An old nobleman — in furred slippers had
sat astride one of them. There he went — she could see him now —
calling down maledictions upon the Irish rebels. He had sunk there,
where her car stood.</p>
<p>‘Time has passed over me,’ she thought, trying to collect
herself; ‘this is the oncome of middle age. How strange it is!
Nothing is any longer one thing. I take up a handbag and I think of
an old bumboat woman frozen in the ice. Someone lights a pink
candle and I see a girl in Russian trousers. When I step out of
doors — as I do now,’ here she stepped on to the pavement of Oxford
Street, ‘what is it that I taste? Little herbs. I hear goat bells.
I see mountains. Turkey? India? Persia?’ Her eyes filled with
tears.</p>
<p>That Orlando had gone a little too far from the present moment
will, perhaps, strike the reader who sees her now preparing to get
into her motor-car with her eyes full of tears and visions of
Persian mountains. And indeed, it cannot be denied that the most
successful practitioners of the art of life, often unknown people
by the way, somehow contrive to synchronize the sixty or seventy
different times which beat simultaneously in every normal human
system so that when eleven strikes, all the rest chime in unison,
and the present is neither a violent disruption nor completely
forgotten in the past. Of them we can justly say that they live
precisely the sixty-eight or seventy-two years allotted them on the
tombstone. Of the rest some we know to be dead though they walk
among us; some are not yet born though they go through the forms of
life; others are hundreds of years old though they call themselves
thirty-six. The true length of a person’s life, whatever the
“Dictionary of National Biography” may say, is always a matter of
dispute. For it is a difficult business — this time-keeping;
nothing more quickly disorders it than contact with any of the
arts; and it may have been her love of poetry that was to blame for
making Orlando lose her shopping list and start home without the
sardines, the bath salts, or the boots. Now as she stood with her
hand on the door of her motor-car, the present again struck her on
the head. Eleven times she was violently assaulted.</p>
<p>‘Confound it all!’ she cried, for it is a great shock to the
nervous system, hearing a clock strike — so much so that for some
time now there is nothing to be said of her save that she frowned
slightly, changed her gears admirably, and cried out, as before,
‘Look where you’re going!’ ‘Don’t you know your own mind?’ ‘Why
didn’t you say so then?’ while the motor-car shot, swung, squeezed,
and slid, for she was an expert driver, down Regent Street, down
Haymarket, down Northumberland Avenue, over Westminster Bridge, to
the left, straight on, to the right, straight on again…</p>
<p>The Old Kent Road was very crowded on Thursday, the eleventh of
October 1928. People spilt off the pavement. There were women with
shopping bags. Children ran out. There were sales at drapers’
shops. Streets widened and narrowed. Long vistas steadily shrunk
together. Here was a market. Here a funeral. Here a procession with
banners upon which was written ‘Ra — Un’, but what else? Meat was
very red. Butchers stood at the door. Women almost had their heels
sliced off. Amor Vin — that was over a porch. A woman looked out of
a bedroom window, profoundly contemplative, and very still.
Applejohn and Applebed, Undert —. Nothing could be seen whole or
read from start to finish. What was seen begun — like two friends
starting to meet each other across the street — was never seen
ended. After twenty minutes the body and mind were like scraps of
torn paper tumbling from a sack and, indeed, the process of
motoring fast out of London so much resembles the chopping up small
of identity which precedes unconsciousness and perhaps death itself
that it is an open question in what sense Orlando can be said to
have existed at the present moment. Indeed we should have given her
over for a person entirely disassembled were it not that here, at
last, one green screen was held out on the right, against which the
little bits of paper fell more slowly; and then another was held
out on the left so that one could see the separate scraps now
turning over by themselves in the air; and then green screens were
held continuously on either side, so that her mind regained the
illusion of holding things within itself and she saw a cottage, a
farmyard and four cows, all precisely life-size.</p>
<p>When this happened, Orlando heaved a sigh of relief, lit a
cigarette, and puffed for a minute or two in silence. Then she
called hesitatingly, as if the person she wanted might not be
there, ‘Orlando? For if there are (at a venture) seventy-six
different times all ticking in the mind at once, how many different
people are there not — Heaven help us — all having lodgment at one
time or another in the human spirit? Some say two thousand and
fifty-two. So that it is the most usual thing in the world for a
person to call, directly they are alone, Orlando? (if that is one’s
name) meaning by that, Come, come! I’m sick to death of this
particular self. I want another. Hence, the astonishing changes we
see in our friends. But it is not altogether plain sailing, either,
for though one may say, as Orlando said (being out in the country
and needing another self presumably) Orlando? still the Orlando she
needs may not come; these selves of which we are built up, one on
top of another, as plates are piled on a waiter’s hand, have
attachments elsewhere, sympathies, little constitutions and rights
of their own, call them what you will (and for many of these things
there is no name) so that one will only come if it is raining,
another in a room with green curtains, another when Mrs Jones is
not there, another if you can promise it a glass of wine — and so
on; for everybody can multiply from his own experience the
different terms which his different selves have made with him — and
some are too wildly ridiculous to be mentioned in print at all.</p>
<p>So Orlando, at the turn by the barn, called ‘Orlando?’ with a
note of interrogation in her voice and waited. Orlando did not
come.</p>
<p>‘All right then,’ Orlando said, with the good humour people
practise on these occasions; and tried another. For she had a great
variety of selves to call upon, far more than we have been able to
find room for, since a biography is considered complete if it
merely accounts for six or seven selves, whereas a person may well
have as many thousand. Choosing then, only those selves we have
found room for, Orlando may now have called on the boy who cut the
nigger’s head down; the boy who strung it up again; the boy who sat
on the hill; the boy who saw the poet; the boy who handed the Queen
the bowl of rose water; or she may have called upon the young man
who fell in love with Sasha; or upon the Courtier; or upon the
Ambassador; or upon the Soldier; or upon the Traveller; or she may
have wanted the woman to come to her; the Gipsy; the Fine Lady; the
Hermit; the girl in love with life; the Patroness of Letters; the
woman who called Mar (meaning hot baths and evening fires) or
Shelmerdine (meaning crocuses in autumn woods) or Bonthrop (meaning
the death we die daily) or all three together — which meant more
things than we have space to write out — all were different and she
may have called upon any one of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps; but what appeared certain (for we are now in the region
of ‘perhaps’ and ‘appears’) was that the one she needed most kept
aloof, for she was, to hear her talk, changing her selves as
quickly as she drove — there was a new one at every corner — as
happens when, for some unaccountable reason, the conscious self,
which is the uppermost, and has the power to desire, wishes to be
nothing but one self. This is what some people call the true self,
and it is, they say, compact of all the selves we have it in us to
be; commanded and locked up by the Captain self, the Key self,
which amalgamates and controls them all. Orlando was certainly
seeking this self as the reader can judge from overhearing her talk
as she drove (and if it is rambling talk, disconnected, trivial,
dull, and sometimes unintelligible, it is the reader’s fault for
listening to a lady talking to herself; we only copy her words as
she spoke them, adding in brackets which self in our opinion is
speaking, but in this we may well be wrong).</p>
<p>‘What then? Who then?’ she said. ‘Thirty-six; in a motor-car; a
woman. Yes, but a million other things as well. A snob am I? The
garter in the hall? The leopards? My ancestors? Proud of them? Yes!
Greedy, luxurious, vicious? Am I? (here a new self came in). Don’t
care a damn if I am. Truthful? I think so. Generous? Oh, but that
don’t count (here a new self came in). Lying in bed of a morning
listening to the pigeons on fine linen; silver dishes; wine; maids;
footmen. Spoilt? Perhaps. Too many things for nothing. Hence my
books (here she mentioned fifty classical titles; which
represented, so we think, the early romantic works that she tore
up). Facile, glib, romantic. But (here another self came in) a
duffer, a fumbler. More clumsy I couldn’t be. And — and —(here she
hesitated for a word and if we suggest ‘Love’ we may be wrong, but
certainly she laughed and blushed and then cried out —) A toad set
in emeralds! Harry the Archduke! Blue-bottles on the ceiling! (here
another self came in). But Nell, Kit, Sasha? (she was sunk in
gloom: tears actually shaped themselves and she had long given over
crying). Trees, she said. (Here another self came in.) I love trees
(she was passing a clump) growing there a thousand years. And barns
(she passed a tumbledown barn at the edge of the road). And sheep
dogs (here one came trotting across the road. She carefully avoided
it). And the night. But people (here another self came in). People?
(She repeated it as a question.) I don’t know. Chattering,
spiteful, always telling lies. (Here she turned into the High
Street of her native town, which was crowded, for it was market
day, with farmers, and shepherds, and old women with hens in
baskets.) I like peasants. I understand crops. But (here another
self came skipping over the top of her mind like the beam from a
lighthouse). Fame! (She laughed.) Fame! Seven editions. A prize.
Photographs in the evening papers (here she alluded to the ‘Oak
Tree’ and ‘The Burdett Coutts’ Memorial Prize which she had won;
and we must snatch space to remark how discomposing it is for her
biographer that this culmination to which the whole book moved,
this peroration with which the book was to end, should be dashed
from us on a laugh casually like this; but the truth is that when
we write of a woman, everything is out of place — culminations and
perorations; the accent never falls where it does with a man).
Fame! she repeated. A poet — a charlatan; both every morning as
regularly as the post comes in. To dine, to meet; to meet, to dine;
fame — fame! (She had here to slow down to pass through the crowd
of market people. But no one noticed her. A porpoise in a
fishmonger’s shop attracted far more attention than a lady who had
won a prize and might, had she chosen, have worn three coronets one
on top of another on her brow.) Driving very slowly she now hummed
as if it were part of an old song, ‘With my guineas I’ll buy
flowering trees, flowering trees, flowering trees and walk among my
flowering trees and tell my sons what fame is’. So she hummed, and
now all her words began to sag here and there like a barbaric
necklace of heavy beads. ‘And walk among my flowering trees,’ she
sang, accenting the words strongly, ‘and see the moon rise slow,
the waggons go… ’ Here she stopped short and looked ahead of her
intently at the bonnet of the car in profound meditation.</p>
<p>‘He sat at Twitchett’s table,’ she mused, ‘with a dirty ruff on…
Was it old Mr Baker come to measure the timber? Or was it Sh-p —
re? (for when we speak names we deeply reverence to ourselves we
never speak them whole.) She gazed for ten minutes ahead of her,
letting the car come almost to a standstill.</p>
<p>‘Haunted!’ she cried, suddenly pressing the accelerator.
‘Haunted! ever since I was a child. There flies the wild goose. It
flies past the window out to sea. Up I jumped (she gripped the
steering-wheel tighter) and stretched after it. But the goose flies
too fast. I’ve seen it, here — there — there — England, Persia,
Italy. Always it flies fast out to sea and always I fling after it
words like nets (here she flung her hand out) which shrivel as I’ve
seen nets shrivel drawn on deck with only sea-weed in them; and
sometimes there’s an inch of silver — six words — in the bottom of
the net. But never the great fish who lives in the coral groves.’
Here she bent her head, pondering deeply.</p>
<p>And it was at this moment, when she had ceased to call ‘Orlando’
and was deep in thoughts of something else, that the Orlando whom
she had called came of its own accord; as was proved by the change
that now came over her (she had passed through the lodge gates and
was entering the park).</p>
<p>The whole of her darkened and settled, as when some foil whose
addition makes the round and solidity of a surface is added to it,
and the shallow becomes deep and the near distant; and all is
contained as water is contained by the sides of a well. So she was
now darkened, stilled, and become, with the addition of this
Orlando, what is called, rightly or wrongly, a single self, a real
self. And she fell silent. For it is probable that when people talk
aloud, the selves (of which there may be more than two thousand)
are conscious of disseverment, and are trying to communicate, but
when communication is established they fall silent.</p>
<p>Masterfully, swiftly, she drove up the curving drive between the
elms and oaks through the falling turf of the park whose fall was
so gentle that had it been water it would have spread the beach
with a smooth green tide. Planted here and in solemn groups were
beech trees and oak trees. The deer stepped among them, one white
as snow, another with its head on one side, for some wire netting
had caught in its horns. All this, the trees, deer, and turf, she
observed with the greatest satisfaction as if her mind had become a
fluid that flowed round things and enclosed them completely. Next
minute she drew up in the courtyard where, for so many hundred
years she had come, on horseback or in coach and six, with men
riding before or coming after; where plumes had tossed, torches
flashed, and the same flowering trees that let their leaves drop
now had shaken their blossoms. Now she was alone. The autumn leaves
were falling. The porter opened the great gates. ‘Morning, James,’
she said, ‘there’re some things in the car. Will you bring ‘em in?’
words of no beauty, interest, or significance themselves, it will
be conceded, but now so plumped out with meaning that they fell
like ripe nuts from a tree, and proved that when the shrivelled
skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the
senses amazingly. This was true indeed of every movement and action
now, usual though they were; so that to see Orlando change her
skirt for a pair of whipcord breeches and leather jacket, which she
did in less than three minutes, was to be ravished with the beauty
of movement as if Madame Lopokova were using her highest art. Then
she strode into the dining-room where her old friends Dryden, Pope,
Swift, Addison regarded her demurely at first as who should say
Here’s the prize winner! but when they reflected that two hundred
guineas was in question, they nodded their heads approvingly. Two
hundred guineas, they seemed to say; two hundred guineas are not to
be sniffed at. She cut herself a slice of bread and ham, clapped
the two together and began to eat, striding up and down the room,
thus shedding her company habits in a second, without thinking.
After five or six such turns, she tossed off a glass of red Spanish
wine, and, filling another which she carried in her hand, strode
down the long corridor and through a dozen drawing-rooms and so
began a perambulation of the house, attended by such elk-hounds and
spaniels as chose to follow her.</p>
<p>This, too, was all in the day’s routine. As soon would she come
home and leave her own grandmother without a kiss as come back and
leave the house unvisited. She fancied that the rooms brightened as
she came in; stirred, opened their eyes as if they had been dozing
in her absence. She fancied, too, that, hundreds and thousands of
times as she had seen them, they never looked the same twice, as if
so long a life as theirs had stored in them a myriad moods which
changed with winter and summer, bright weather and dark, and her
own fortunes and the people’s characters who visited them. Polite,
they always were to strangers, but a little weary: with her, they
were entirely open and at their ease. Why not indeed? They had
known each other for close on four centuries now. They had nothing
to conceal. She knew their sorrows and joys. She knew what age each
part of them was and its little secrets — a hidden drawer, a
concealed cupboard, or some deficiency perhaps, such as a part made
up, or added later. They, too, knew her in all her moods and
changes. She had hidden nothing from them; had come to them as boy
and woman, crying and dancing, brooding and gay. In this
window-seat, she had written her first verses; in that chapel, she
had been married. And she would be buried here, she reflected,
kneeling on the window-sill in the long gallery and sipping her
Spanish wine. Though she could hardly fancy it, the body of the
heraldic leopard would be making yellow pools on the floor the day
they lowered her to lie among her ancestors. She, who believed in
no immortality, could not help feeling that her soul would come and
go forever with the reds on the panels and the greens on the sofa.
For the room — she had strolled into the Ambassador’s bedroom —
shone like a shell that has lain at the bottom of the sea for
centuries and has been crusted over and painted a million tints by
the water; it was rose and yellow, green and sand-coloured. It was
frail as a shell, as iridescent and as empty. No Ambassador would
ever sleep there again. Ah, but she knew where the heart of the
house still beat. Gently opening a door, she stood on the threshold
so that (as she fancied) the room could not see her and watched the
tapestry rising and falling on the eternal faint breeze which never
failed to move it. Still the hunter rode; still Daphne flew. The
heart still beat, she thought, however faintly, however far
withdrawn; the frail indomitable heart of the immense building.</p>
<p>Now, calling her troop of dogs to her she passed down the
gallery whose floor was laid with whole oak trees sawn across. Rows
of chairs with all their velvets faded stood ranged against the
wall holding their arms out for Elizabeth, for James, for
Shakespeare it might be, for Cecil, who never came. The sight made
her gloomy. She unhooked the rope that fenced them off. She sat on
the Queen’s chair; she opened a manuscript book lying on Lady
Betty’s table; she stirred her fingers in the aged rose leaves; she
brushed her short hair with King James’ silver brushes: she bounced
up and down upon his bed (but no King would ever sleep there again,
for all Louise’s new sheets) and pressed her cheek against the worn
silver counterpane that lay upon it. But everywhere were little
lavender bags to keep the moth out and printed notices, ‘Please do
not touch’, which, though she had put them there herself, seemed to
rebuke her. The house was no longer hers entirely, she sighed. It
belonged to time now; to history; was past the touch and control of
the living. Never would beer be spilt here any more, she thought
(she was in the bedroom that had been old Nick Greene’s), or holes
burnt in the carpet. Never two hundred servants come running and
brawling down the corridors with warming pans and great branches
for the great fireplaces. Never would ale be brewed and candles
made and saddles fashioned and stone shaped in the workshops
outside the house. Hammers and mallets were silent now. Chairs and
beds were empty; tankards of silver and gold were locked in glass
cases. The great wings of silence beat up and down the empty
house.</p>
<p>So she sat at the end of the gallery with her dogs couched round
her, in Queen Elizabeth’s hard armchair. The gallery stretched far
away to a point where the light almost failed. It was as a tunnel
bored deep into the past. As her eyes peered down it, she could see
people laughing and talking; the great men she had known; Dryden,
Swift, and Pope; and statesmen in colloquy; and lovers dallying in
the window-seats; and people eating and drinking at the long
tables; and the wood smoke curling round their heads and making
them sneeze and cough. Still further down, she saw sets of splendid
dancers formed for the quadrille. A fluty, frail, but nevertheless
stately music began to play. An organ boomed. A coffin was borne
into the chapel. A marriage procession came out of it. Armed men
with helmets left for the wars. They brought banners back from
Flodden and Poitiers and stuck them on the wall. The long gallery
filled itself thus, and still peering further, she thought she
could make out at the very end, beyond the Elizabethans and the
Tudors, some one older, further, darker, a cowled figure, monastic,
severe, a monk, who went with his hands clasped, and a book in
them, murmuring&#160;—</p>
<p>Like thunder, the stable clock struck four. Never did any
earthquake so demolish a whole town. The gallery and all its
occupants fell to powder. Her own face, that had been dark and
sombre as she gazed, was lit as by an explosion of gunpowder. In
this same light everything near her showed with extreme
distinctness. She saw two flies circling round and noticed the blue
sheen on their bodies; she saw a knot in the wood where her foot
was, and her dog’s ear twitching. At the same time, she heard a
bough creaking in the garden, a sheep coughing in the park, a swift
screaming past the window. Her own body quivered and tingled as if
suddenly stood naked in a hard frost. Yet, she kept, as she had not
done when the clock struck ten in London, complete composure (for
she was now one and entire, and presented, it may be, a larger
surface to the shock of time). She rose, but without precipitation,
called her dogs, and went firmly but with great alertness of
movement down the staircase and out into the garden. Here the
shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct. She noticed the
separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a
microscope stuck to her eye. She saw the intricacy of the twigs of
every tree. Each blade of grass was distinct and the marking of
veins and petals. She saw Stubbs, the gardener, coming along the
path, and every button on his gaiters was visible; she saw Betty
and Prince, the cart horses, and never had she marked so clearly
the white star on Betty’s forehead, and the three long hairs that
fell down below the rest on Prince’s tail. Out in the quadrangle
the old grey walls of the house looked like a scraped new
photograph; she heard the loud speaker condensing on the terrace a
dance tune that people were listening to in the red velvet opera
house at Vienna. Braced and strung up by the present moment she was
also strangely afraid, as if whenever the gulf of time gaped and
let a second through some unknown danger might come with it. The
tension was too relentless and too rigorous to be endured long
without discomfort. She walked more briskly than she liked, as if
her legs were moved for her, through the garden and out into the
park. Here she forced herself, by a great effort, to stop by the
carpenter’s shop, and to stand stock-still watching Joe Stubbs
fashion a cart wheel. She was standing with her eye fixed on his
hand when the quarter struck. It hurtled through her like a meteor,
so hot that no fingers can hold it. She saw with disgusting
vividness that the thumb on Joe’s right hand was without a finger
nail and there was a raised saucer of pink flesh where the nail
should have been. The sight was so repulsive that she felt faint
for a moment, but in that moment’s darkness, when her eyelids
flickered, she was relieved of the pressure of the present. There
was something strange in the shadow that the flicker of her eyes
cast, something which (as anyone can test for himself by looking
now at the sky) is always absent from the present — whence its
terror, its nondescript character — something one trembles to pin
through the body with a name and call beauty, for it has no body,
is as a shadow without substance or quality of its own, yet has the
power to change whatever it adds itself to. This shadow now, while
she flickered her eye in her faintness in the carpenter’s shop,
stole out, and attaching itself to the innumerable sights she had
been receiving, composed them into something tolerable,
comprehensible. Her mind began to toss like the sea. Yes, she
thought, heaving a deep sigh of relief, as she turned from the
carpenter’s shop to climb the hill, I can begin to live again. I am
by the Serpentine, she thought, the little boat is climbing through
the white arch of a thousand deaths. I am about to understand…</p>
<p>Those were her words, spoken quite distinctly, but we cannot
conceal the fact that she was now a very indifferent witness to the
truth of what was before her and might easily have mistaken a sheep
for a cow, or an old man called Smith for one who was called Jones
and was no relation of his whatever. For the shadow of faintness
which the thumb without a nail had cast had deepened now, at the
back of her brain (which is the part furthest from sight), into a
pool where things dwell in darkness so deep that what they are we
scarcely know. She now looked down into this pool or sea in which
everything is reflected — and, indeed, some say that all our most
violent passions, and art and religion, are the reflections which
we see in the dark hollow at the back of the head when the visible
world is obscured for the time. She looked there now, long, deeply,
profoundly, and immediately the ferny path up the hill along which
she was walking became not entirely a path, but partly the
Serpentine; the hawthorn bushes were partly ladies and gentlemen
sitting with card-cases and gold-mounted canes; the sheep were
partly tall Mayfair houses; everything was partly something else,
as if her mind had become a forest with glades branching here and
there; things came nearer, and further, and mingled and separated
and made the strangest alliances and combinations in an incessant
chequer of light and shade. Except when Canute, the elk-hound,
chased a rabbit and so reminded her that it must be about half past
four — it was indeed twenty-three minutes to six — she forgot the
time.</p>
<p>The ferny path led, with many turns and windings, higher and
higher to the oak tree, which stood on the top. The tree had grown
bigger, sturdier, and more knotted since she had known it,
somewhere about the year 1588, but it was still in the prime of
life. The little sharply frilled leaves were still fluttering
thickly on its branches. Flinging herself on the ground, she felt
the bones of the tree running out like ribs from a spine this way
and that beneath her. She liked to think that she was riding the
back of the world. She liked to attach herself to something hard.
As she flung herself down a little square book bound in red cloth
fell from the breast of her leather jacket — her poem ‘The Oak
Tree’. ‘I should have brought a trowel,’ she reflected. The earth
was so shallow over the roots that it seemed doubtful if she could
do as she meant and bury the book here. Besides, the dogs would dig
it up. No luck ever attends these symbolical celebrations, she
thought. Perhaps it would be as well then to do without them. She
had a little speech on the tip of her tongue which she meant to
speak over the book as she buried it. (It was a copy of the first
edition, signed by author and artist.) ‘I bury this as a tribute,’
she was going to have said, ‘a return to the land of what the land
has given me,’ but Lord! once one began mouthing words aloud, how
silly they sounded! She was reminded of old Greene getting upon a
platform the other day comparing her with Milton (save for his
blindness) and handing her a cheque for two hundred guineas. She
had thought then, of the oak tree here on its hill, and what has
that got to do with this, she had wondered? What has praise and
fame to do with poetry? What has seven editions (the book had
already gone into no less) got to do with the value of it? Was not
writing poetry a secret transaction, a voice answering a voice? So
that all this chatter and praise and blame and meeting people who
admired one and meeting people who did not admire one was as ill
suited as could be to the thing itself — a voice answering a voice.
What could have been more secret, she thought, more slow, and like
the intercourse of lovers, than the stammering answer she had made
all these years to the old crooning song of the woods, and the
farms and the brown horses standing at the gate, neck to neck, and
the smithy and the kitchen and the fields, so laboriously bearing
wheat, turnips, grass, and the garden blowing irises and
fritillaries?</p>
<p>So she let her book lie unburied and dishevelled on the ground,
and watched the vast view, varied like an ocean floor this evening
with the sun lightening it and the shadows darkening it. There was
a village with a church tower among elm trees; a grey domed manor
house in a park; a spark of light burning on some glass-house; a
farmyard with yellow corn stacks. The fields were marked with black
tree clumps, and beyond the fields stretched long woodlands, and
there was the gleam of a river, and then hills again. In the far
distance Snowdon’s crags broke white among the clouds; she saw the
far Scottish hills and the wild tides that swirl about the
Hebrides. She listened for the sound of gun-firing out at sea. No —
only the wind blew. There was no war to-day. Drake had gone; Nelson
had gone. ‘And there’, she thought, letting her eyes, which had
been looking at these far distances, drop once more to the land
beneath her, ‘was my land once: that Castle between the downs was
mine; and all that moor running almost to the sea was mine.’ Here
the landscape (it must have been some trick of the fading light)
shook itself, heaped itself, let all this encumbrance of houses,
castles, and woods slide off its tent-shaped sides. The bare
mountains of Turkey were before her. It was blazing noon. She
looked straight at the baked hill-side. Goats cropped the sandy
tufts at her feet. An eagle soared above. The raucous voice of old
Rustum, the gipsy, croaked in her ears, ‘What is your antiquity and
your race, and your possessions compared with this? What do you
need with four hundred bedrooms and silver lids on all your dishes,
and housemaids dusting?’</p>
<p>At this moment some church clock chimed in the valley. The
tent-like landscape collapsed and fell. The present showered down
upon her head once more, but now that the light was fading,
gentlier than before, calling into view nothing detailed, nothing
small, but only misty fields, cottages with lamps in them, the
slumbering bulk of a wood, and a fan-shaped light pushing the
darkness before it along some lane. Whether it had struck nine,
ten, or eleven, she could not say. Night had come — night that she
loved of all times, night in which the reflections in the dark pool
of the mind shine more clearly than by day. It was not necessary to
faint now in order to look deep into the darkness where things
shape themselves and to see in the pool of the mind now
Shakespeare, now a girl in Russian trousers, now a toy boat on the
Serpentine, and then the Atlantic itself, where it storms in great
waves past Cape Horn. She looked into the darkness. There was her
husband’s brig, rising to the top of the wave! Up, it went, and up
and up. The white arch of a thousand deaths rose before it. Oh
rash, oh ridiculous man, always sailing, so uselessly, round Cape
Horn in the teeth of a gale! But the brig was through the arch and
out on the other side; it was safe at last!</p>
<p>‘Ecstasy!’ she cried, ‘ecstasy!’ And then the wind sank, the
waters grew calm; and she saw the waves rippling peacefully in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>‘Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine!’ she cried, standing by the oak
tree.</p>
<p>The beautiful, glittering name fell out of the sky like a
steel-blue feather. She watched it fall, turning and twisting like
a slow-falling arrow that cleaves the deep air beautifully. He was
coming, as he always came, in moments of dead calm; when the wave
rippled and the spotted leaves fell slowly over her foot in the
autumn woods; when the leopard was still; the moon was on the
waters, and nothing moved in between sky and sea. Then he came.</p>
<p>All was still now. It was near midnight. The moon rose slowly
over the weald. Its light raised a phantom castle upon earth. There
stood the great house with all its windows robed in silver. Of wall
or substance there was none. All was phantom. All was still. All
was lit as for the coming of a dead Queen. Gazing below her,
Orlando saw dark plumes tossing in the courtyard, and torches
flickering and shadows kneeling. A Queen once more stepped from her
chariot.</p>
<p>‘The house is at your service, Ma’am,’ she cried, curtseying
deeply. ‘Nothing has been changed. The dead Lord, my father, shall
lead you in.’</p>
<p>As she spoke, the first stroke of midnight sounded. The cold
breeze of the present brushed her face with its little breath of
fear. She looked anxiously into the sky. It was dark with clouds
now. The wind roared in her ears. But in the roar of the wind she
heard the roar of an aeroplane coming nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>‘Here! Shel, here!’ she cried, baring her breast to the moon
(which now showed bright) so that her pearls glowed — like the eggs
of some vast moon-spider. The aeroplane rushed out of the clouds
and stood over her head. It hovered above her. Her pearls burnt
like a phosphorescent flare in the darkness.</p>
<p>And as Shelmerdine, now grown a fine sea captain, hale,
fresh-coloured, and alert, leapt to the ground, there sprang up
over his head a single wild bird.</p>
<p>‘It is the goose!’ Orlando cried. ‘The wild goose… ’</p>
<p>And the twelfth stroke of midnight sounded; the twelfth stroke
of midnight, Thursday, the eleventh of October, Nineteen hundred
and Twenty Eight.</p>
