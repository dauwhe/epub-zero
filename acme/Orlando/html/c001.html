<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
</div>

<p>He — for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the
time did something to disguise it — was in the act of slicing at
the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters. It was the colour
of an old football, and more or less the shape of one, save for the
sunken cheeks and a strand or two of coarse, dry hair, like the
hair on a cocoanut. Orlando’s father, or perhaps his grandfather,
had struck it from the shoulders of a vast Pagan who had started up
under the moon in the barbarian fields of Africa; and now it swung,
gently, perpetually, in the breeze which never ceased blowing
through the attic rooms of the gigantic house of the lord who had
slain him.</p>
<p>Orlando’s fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel, and stony
fields, and fields watered by strange rivers, and they had struck
many heads of many colours off many shoulders, and brought them
back to hang from the rafters. So too would Orlando, he vowed. But
since he was sixteen only, and too young to ride with them in
Africa or France, he would steal away from his mother and the
peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and
plunge and slice the air with his blade. Sometimes he cut the cord
so that the skull bumped on the floor and he had to string it up
again, fastening it with some chivalry almost out of reach so that
his enemy grinned at him through shrunk, black lips triumphantly.
The skull swung to and fro, for the house, at the top of which he
lived, was so vast that there seemed trapped in it the wind itself,
blowing this way, blowing that way, winter and summer. The green
arras with the hunters on it moved perpetually. His fathers had
been noble since they had been at all. They came out of the
northern mists wearing coronets on their heads. Were not the bars
of darkness in the room, and the yellow pools which chequered the
floor, made by the sun falling through the stained glass of a vast
coat of arms in the window? Orlando stood now in the midst of the
yellow body of an heraldic leopard. When he put his hand on the
window-sill to push the window open, it was instantly coloured red,
blue, and yellow like a butterfly’s wing. Thus, those who like
symbols, and have a turn for the deciphering of them, might observe
that though the shapely legs, the handsome body, and the well-set
shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic
light, Orlando’s face, as he threw the window open, was lit solely
by the sun itself. A more candid, sullen face it would be
impossible to find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still the
biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex
herself, nor he invoke the help of novelist or poet. From deed to
deed, from glory to glory, from office to office he must go, his
scribe following after, till they reach whatever seat it may be
that is the height of their desire. Orlando, to look at, was cut
out precisely for some such career. The red of the cheeks was
covered with peach down; the down on the lips was only a little
thicker than the down on the cheeks. The lips themselves were short
and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond
whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in its short, tense
flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted closely to
the head. But, alas, that these catalogues of youthful beauty
cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes. Alas, that people
are seldom born devoid of all three; for directly we glance at
Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like
drenched violets, so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in
them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble
dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were his
temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we
rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to
admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good
biographer to ignore. Sights disturbed him, like that of his
mother, a very beautiful lady in green walking out to feed the
peacocks with Twitchett, her maid, behind her; sights exalted him —
the birds and the trees; and made him in love with death — the
evening sky, the homing rooks; and so, mounting up the spiral
stairway into his brain — which was a roomy one — all these sights,
and the garden sounds too, the hammer beating, the wood chopping,
began that riot and confusion of the passions and emotions which
every good biographer detests, But to continue — Orlando slowly
drew in his head, sat down at the table, and, with the
half-conscious air of one doing what they do every day of their
lives at this hour, took out a writing book labelled ‘Aethelbert: A
Tragedy in Five Acts,’ and dipped an old stained goose quill in the
ink.</p>
<p>Soon he had covered ten pages and more with poetry. He was
fluent, evidently, but he was abstract. Vice, Crime, Misery were
the personages of his drama; there were Kings and Queens of
impossible territories; horrid plots confounded them; noble
sentiments suffused them; there was never a word said as he himself
would have said it, but all was turned with a fluency and sweetness
which, considering his age — he was not yet seventeen — and that
the sixteenth century had still some years of its course to run,
were remarkable enough. At last, however, he came to a halt. He was
describing, as all young poets are for ever describing, nature, and
in order to match the shade of green precisely he looked (and here
he showed more audacity than most) at the thing itself, which
happened to be a laurel bush growing beneath the window. After
that, of course, he could write no more. Green in nature is one
thing, green in literature another. Nature and letters seem to have
a natural antipathy; bring them together and they tear each other
to pieces. The shade of green Orlando now saw spoilt his rhyme and
split his metre. Moreover, nature has tricks of her own. Once look
out of a window at bees among flowers, at a yawning dog, at the sun
setting, once think ‘how many more suns shall I see set’, etc. etc.
(the thought is too well known to be worth writing out) and one
drops the pen, takes one’s cloak, strides out of the room, and
catches one’s foot on a painted chest as one does so. For Orlando
was a trifle clumsy.</p>
<p>He was careful to avoid meeting anyone. There was Stubbs, the
gardener, coming along the path. He hid behind a tree till he had
passed. He let himself out at a little gate in the garden wall. He
skirted all stables, kennels, breweries, carpenters’ shops,
washhouses, places where they make tallow candles, kill oxen, forge
horse-shoes, stitch jerkins — for the house was a town ringing with
men at work at their various crafts — and gained the ferny path
leading uphill through the park unseen. There is perhaps a kinship
among qualities; one draws another along with it; and the
biographer should here call attention to the fact that this
clumsiness is often mated with a love of solitude. Having stumbled
over a chest, Orlando naturally loved solitary places, vast views,
and to feel himself for ever and ever and ever alone.</p>
<p>So, after a long silence, ‘I am alone’, he breathed at last,
opening his lips for the first time in this record. He had walked
very quickly uphill through ferns and hawthorn bushes, startling
deer and wild birds, to a place crowned by a single oak tree. It
was very high, so high indeed that nineteen English counties could
be seen beneath; and on clear days thirty or perhaps forty, if the
weather was very fine. Sometimes one could see the English Channel,
wave reiterating upon wave. Rivers could be seen and pleasure boats
gliding on them; and galleons setting out to sea; and armadas with
puffs of smoke from which came the dull thud of cannon firing; and
forts on the coast; and castles among the meadows; and here a watch
tower; and there a fortress; and again some vast mansion like that
of Orlando’s father, massed like a town in the valley circled by
walls. To the east there were the spires of London and the smoke of
the city; and perhaps on the very sky line, when the wind was in
the right quarter, the craggy top and serrated edges of Snowdon
herself showed mountainous among the clouds. For a moment Orlando
stood counting, gazing, recognizing. That was his father’s house;
that his uncle’s. His aunt owned those three great turrets among
the trees there. The heath was theirs and the forest; the pheasant
and the deer, the fox, the badger, and the butterfly.</p>
<p>He sighed profoundly, and flung himself — there was a passion in
his movements which deserves the word — on the earth at the foot of
the oak tree. He loved, beneath all this summer transiency, to feel
the earth’s spine beneath him; for such he took the hard root of
the oak tree to be; or, for image followed image, it was the back
of a great horse that he was riding, or the deck of a tumbling ship
— it was anything indeed, so long as it was hard, for he felt the
need of something which he could attach his floating heart to; the
heart that tugged at his side; the heart that seemed filled with
spiced and amorous gales every evening about this time when he
walked out. To the oak tree he tied it and as he lay there,
gradually the flutter in and about him stilled itself; the little
leaves hung, the deer stopped; the pale summer clouds stayed; his
limbs grew heavy on the ground; and he lay so still that by degrees
the deer stepped nearer and the rooks wheeled round him and the
swallows dipped and circled and the dragonflies shot past, as if
all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer’s evening were
woven web-like about his body.</p>
<p>After an hour or so — the sun was rapidly sinking, the white
clouds had turned red, the hills were violet, the woods purple, the
valleys black — a trumpet sounded. Orlando leapt to his feet. The
shrill sound came from the valley. It came from a dark spot down
there; a spot compact and mapped out; a maze; a town, yet girt
about with walls; it came from the heart of his own great house in
the valley, which, dark before, even as he looked and the single
trumpet duplicated and reduplicated itself with other shriller
sounds, lost its darkness and became pierced with lights. Some were
small hurrying lights, as if servants dashed along corridors to
answer summonses; others were high and lustrous lights, as if they
burnt in empty banqueting-halls made ready to receive guests who
had not come; and others dipped and waved and sank and rose, as if
held in the hands of troops of serving men, bending, kneeling,
rising, receiving, guarding, and escorting with all dignity indoors
a great Princess alighting from her chariot. Coaches turned and
wheeled in the courtyard. Horses tossed their plumes. The Queen had
come.</p>
<p>Orlando looked no more. He dashed downhill. He let himself in at
a wicket gate. He tore up the winding staircase. He reached his
room. He tossed his stockings to one side of the room, his jerkin
to the other. He dipped his head. He scoured his hands. He pared
his finger nails. With no more than six inches of looking-glass and
a pair of old candles to help him, he had thrust on crimson
breeches, lace collar, waistcoat of taffeta, and shoes with
rosettes on them as big as double dahlias in less than ten minutes
by the stable clock. He was ready. He was flushed. He was excited,
But he was terribly late.</p>
<p>By short cuts known to him, he made his way now through the vast
congeries of rooms and staircases to the banqueting-hall, five
acres distant on the other side of the house. But half-way there,
in the back quarters where the servants lived, he stopped. The door
of Mrs Stewkley’s sitting-room stood open — she was gone,
doubtless, with all her keys to wait upon her mistress. But there,
sitting at the servant’s dinner table with a tankard beside him and
paper in front of him, sat a rather fat, shabby man, whose ruff was
a thought dirty, and whose clothes were of hodden brown. He held a
pen in his hand, but he was not writing. He seemed in the act of
rolling some thought up and down, to and fro in his mind till it
gathered shape or momentum to his liking. His eyes, globed and
clouded like some green stone of curious texture, were fixed. He
did not see Orlando. For all his hurry, Orlando stopped dead. Was
this a poet? Was he writing poetry? ‘Tell me’, he wanted to say,
‘everything in the whole world’— for he had the wildest, most
absurd, extravagant ideas about poets and poetry — but how speak to
a man who does not see you? who sees ogres, satyrs, perhaps the
depths of the sea instead? So Orlando stood gazing while the man
turned his pen in his fingers, this way and that way; and gazed and
mused; and then, very quickly, wrote half-a-dozen lines and looked
up. Whereupon Orlando, overcome with shyness, darted off and
reached the banqueting-hall only just in time to sink upon his
knees and, hanging his head in confusion, to offer a bowl of rose
water to the great Queen herself.</p>
<p>Such was his shyness that he saw no more of her than her ringed
hands in water; but it was enough. It was a memorable hand; a thin
hand with long fingers always curling as if round orb or sceptre; a
nervous, crabbed, sickly hand; a commanding hand too; a hand that
had only to raise itself for a head to fall; a hand, he guessed,
attached to an old body that smelt like a cupboard in which furs
are kept in camphor; which body was yet caparisoned in all sorts of
brocades and gems; and held itself very upright though perhaps in
pain from sciatica; and never flinched though strung together by a
thousand fears; and the Queen’s eyes were light yellow. All this he
felt as the great rings flashed in the water and then something
pressed his hair — which, perhaps, accounts for his seeing nothing
more likely to be of use to a historian. And in truth, his mind was
such a welter of opposites — of the night and the blazing candles,
of the shabby poet and the great Queen, of silent fields and the
clatter of serving men — that he could see nothing; or only a
hand.</p>
<p>By the same showing, the Queen herself can have seen only a
head. But if it is possible from a hand to deduce a body, informed
with all the attributes of a great Queen, her crabbedness, courage,
frailty, and terror, surely a head can be as fertile, looked down
upon from a chair of state by a lady whose eyes were always, if the
waxworks at the Abbey are to be trusted, wide open. The long,
curled hair, the dark head bent so reverently, so innocently before
her, implied a pair of the finest legs that a young nobleman has
ever stood upright upon; and violet eyes; and a heart of gold; and
loyalty and manly charm — all qualities which the old woman loved
the more the more they failed her. For she was growing old and worn
and bent before her time. The sound of cannon was always in her
ears. She saw always the glistening poison drop and the long
stiletto. As she sat at table she listened; she heard the guns in
the Channel; she dreaded — was that a curse, was that a whisper?
Innocence, simplicity, were all the more dear to her for the dark
background she set them against. And it was that same night, so
tradition has it, when Orlando was sound asleep, that she made over
formally, putting her hand and seal finally to the parchment, the
gift of the great monastic house that had been the Archbishop’s and
then the King’s to Orlando’s father.</p>
<p>Orlando slept all night in ignorance. He had been kissed by a
queen without knowing it. And perhaps, for women’s hearts are
intricate, it was his ignorance and the start he gave when her lips
touched him that kept the memory of her young cousin (for they had
blood in common) green in her mind. At any rate, two years of this
quiet country life had not passed, and Orlando had written no more
perhaps than twenty tragedies and a dozen histories and a score of
sonnets when a message came that he was to attend the Queen at
Whitehall.</p>
<p>‘Here’, she said, watching him advance down the long gallery
towards her, ‘comes my innocent!’ (There was a serenity about him
always which had the look of innocence when, technically, the word
was no longer applicable.)</p>
<p>‘Come!’ she said. She was sitting bolt upright beside the fire.
And she held him a foot’s pace from her and looked him up and down.
Was she matching her speculations the other night with the truth
now visible? Did she find her guesses justified? Eyes, mouth, nose,
breast, hips, hands — she ran them over; her lips twitched visibly
as she looked; but when she saw his legs she laughed out loud. He
was the very image of a noble gentleman. But inwardly? She flashed
her yellow hawk’s eyes upon him as if she would pierce his soul.
The young man withstood her gaze blushing only a damask rose as
became him. Strength, grace, romance, folly, poetry, youth — she
read him like a page. Instantly she plucked a ring from her finger
(the joint was swollen rather) and as she fitted it to his, named
him her Treasurer and Steward; next hung about him chains of
office; and bidding him bend his knee, tied round it at the
slenderest part the jewelled order of the Garter. Nothing after
that was denied him. When she drove in state he rode at her
carriage door. She sent him to Scotland on a sad embassy to the
unhappy Queen. He was about to sail for the Polish wars when she
recalled him. For how could she bear to think of that tender flesh
torn and that curly head rolled in the dust? She kept him with her.
At the height of her triumph when the guns were booming at the
Tower and the air was thick enough with gunpowder to make one
sneeze and the huzzas of the people rang beneath the windows, she
pulled him down among the cushions where her women had laid her
(she was so worn and old) and made him bury his face in that
astonishing composition — she had not changed her dress for a month
— which smelt for all the world, he thought, recalling his boyish
memory, like some old cabinet at home where his mother’s furs were
stored. He rose, half suffocated from the embrace. ‘This’, she
breathed, ‘is my victory!’— even as a rocket roared up and dyed her
cheeks scarlet.</p>
<p>For the old woman loved him. And the Queen, who knew a man when
she saw one, though not, it is said, in the usual way, plotted for
him a splendid ambitious career. Lands were given him, houses
assigned him. He was to be the son of her old age; the limb of her
infirmity; the oak tree on which she leant her degradation. She
croaked out these promises and strange domineering tendernesses
(they were at Richmond now) sitting bolt upright in her stiff
brocades by the fire which, however high they piled it, never kept
her warm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the long winter months drew on. Every tree in the
Park was lined with frost. The river ran sluggishly. One day when
the snow was on the ground and the dark panelled rooms were full of
shadows and the stags were barking in the Park, she saw in the
mirror, which she kept for fear of spies always by her, through the
door, which she kept for fear of murderers always open, a boy —
could it be Orlando? — kissing a girl — who in the Devil’s name was
the brazen hussy? Snatching at her golden-hilted sword she struck
violently at the mirror. The glass crashed; people came running;
she was lifted and set in her chair again; but she was stricken
after that and groaned much, as her days wore to an end, of man’s
treachery.</p>
<p>It was Orlando’s fault perhaps; yet, after all, are we to blame
Orlando? The age was the Elizabethan; their morals were not ours;
nor their poets; nor their climate; nor their vegetables even.
Everything was different. The weather itself, the heat and cold of
summer and winter, was, we may believe, of another temper
altogether. The brilliant amorous day was divided as sheerly from
the night as land from water. Sunsets were redder and more intense;
dawns were whiter and more auroral. Of our crepuscular half-lights
and lingering twilights they knew nothing. The rain fell
vehemently, or not at all. The sun blazed or there was darkness.
Translating this to the spiritual regions as their wont is, the
poets sang beautifully how roses fade and petals fall. The moment
is brief they sang; the moment is over; one long night is then to
be slept by all. As for using the artifices of the greenhouse or
conservatory to prolong or preserve these fresh pinks and roses,
that was not their way. The withered intricacies and ambiguities of
our more gradual and doubtful age were unknown to them. Violence
was all. The flower bloomed and faded. The sun rose and sank. The
lover loved and went. And what the poets said in rhyme, the young
translated into practice. Girls were roses, and their seasons were
short as the flowers’. Plucked they must be before nightfall; for
the day was brief and the day was all. Thus, if Orlando followed
the leading of the climate, of the poets, of the age itself, and
plucked his flower in the window-seat even with the snow on the
ground and the Queen vigilant in the corridor we can scarcely bring
ourselves to blame him. He was young; he was boyish; he did but as
nature bade him do. As for the girl, we know no more than Queen
Elizabeth herself did what her name was. It may have been Doris,
Chloris, Delia, or Diana, for he made rhymes to them all in turn;
equally, she may have been a court lady, or some serving maid. For
Orlando’s taste was broad; he was no lover of garden flowers only;
the wild and the weeds even had always a fascination for him.</p>
<p>Here, indeed, we lay bare rudely, as a biographer may, a curious
trait in him, to be accounted for, perhaps, by the fact that a
certain grandmother of his had worn a smock and carried milkpails.
Some grains of the Kentish or Sussex earth were mixed with the
thin, fine fluid which came to him from Normandy. He held that the
mixture of brown earth and blue blood was a good one. Certain it is
that he had always a liking for low company, especially for that of
lettered people whose wits so often keep them under, as if there
were the sympathy of blood between them. At this season of his
life, when his head brimmed with rhymes and he never went to bed
without striking off some conceit, the cheek of an innkeeper’s
daughter seemed fresher and the wit of a gamekeeper’s niece seemed
quicker than those of the ladies at Court. Hence, he began going
frequently to Wapping Old Stairs and the beer gardens at night,
wrapped in a grey cloak to hide the star at his neck and the garter
at his knee. There, with a mug before him, among the sanded alleys
and bowling greens and all the simple architecture of such places,
he listened to sailors’ stories of hardship and horror and cruelty
on the Spanish main; how some had lost their toes, others their
noses — for the spoken story was never so rounded or so finely
coloured as the written. Especially he loved to hear them volley
forth their songs of ‘the Azores, while the parrakeets, which they
had brought from those parts, pecked at the rings in their ears,
tapped with their hard acquisitive beaks at the rubies on their
fingers, and swore as vilely as their masters. The women were
scarcely less bold in their speech and less free in their manner
than the birds. They perched on his knee, flung their arms round
his neck and, guessing that something out of the common lay hid
beneath his duffle cloak, were quite as eager to come at the truth
of the matter as Orlando himself.</p>
<p>Nor was opportunity lacking. The river was astir early and late
with barges, wherries, and craft of all description. Every day
sailed to sea some fine ship bound for the Indies; now and again
another blackened and ragged with hairy men on board crept
painfully to anchor. No one missed a boy or girl if they dallied a
little on the water after sunset; or raised an eyebrow if gossip
had seen them sleeping soundly among the treasure sacks safe in
each other’s arms. Such indeed was the adventure that befel
Orlando, Sukey, and the Earl of Cumberland. The day was hot; their
loves had been active; they had fallen asleep among the rubies.
Late that night the Earl, whose fortunes were much bound up in the
Spanish ventures, came to check the booty alone with a lantern. He
flashed the light on a barrel. He started back with an oath. Twined
about the cask two spirits lay sleeping. Superstitious by nature,
and his conscience laden with many a crime, the Earl took the
couple — they were wrapped in a red cloak, and Sukey’s bosom was
almost as white as the eternal snows of Orlando’s poetry — for a
phantom sprung from the graves of drowned sailors to upbraid him.
He crossed himself. He vowed repentance. The row of alms houses
still standing in the Sheen Road is the visible fruit of that
moment’s panic. Twelve poor old women of the parish today drink tea
and tonight bless his Lordship for a roof above their heads; so
that illicit love in a treasure ship — but we omit the moral.</p>
<p>Soon, however, Orlando grew tired, not only of the discomfort of
this way of life, and of the crabbed streets of the neighbourhood,
but of the primitive manner of the people. For it has to be
remembered that crime and poverty had none of the attraction for
the Elizabethans that they have for us. They had none of our modern
shame of book learning; none of our belief that to be born the son
of a butcher is a blessing and to be unable to read a virtue; no
fancy that what we call ‘life’ and ‘reality’ are somehow connected
with ignorance and brutality; nor, indeed, any equivalent for these
two words at all. It was not to seek ‘life’ that Orlando went among
them; not in quest of ‘reality’ that he left them. But when he had
heard a score of times how Jakes had lost his nose and Sukey her
honour — and they told the stories admirably, it must be admitted —
he began to be a little weary of the repetition, for a nose can
only be cut off in one way and maidenhood lost in another — or so
it seemed to him — whereas the arts and the sciences had a
diversity about them which stirred his curiosity profoundly. So,
always keeping them in happy memory, he left off frequenting the
beer gardens and the skittle alleys, hung his grey cloak in his
wardrobe, let his star shine at his neck and his garter twinkle at
his knee, and appeared once more at the Court of King James. He was
young, he was rich, he was handsome. No one could have been
received with greater acclamation than he was.</p>
<p>It is certain indeed that many ladies were ready to show him
their favours. The names of three at least were freely coupled with
his in marriage — Clorinda, Favilla, Euphrosyne — so he called them
in his sonnets.</p>
<p>To take them in order; Clorinda was a sweet-mannered gentle lady
enough; — indeed Orlando was greatly taken with her for six months
and a half; but she had white eyelashes and could not bear the
sight of blood. A hare brought up roasted at her father’s table
turned her faint. She was much under the influence of the Priests
too, and stinted her underlinen in order to give to the poor. She
took it on her to reform Orlando of his sins, which sickened him,
so that he drew back from the marriage, and did not much regret it
when she died soon after of the small-pox.</p>
<p>Favilla, who comes next, was of a different sort altogether. She
was the daughter of a poor Somersetshire gentleman; who, by sheer
assiduity and the use of her eyes had worked her way up at court,
where her address in horsemanship, her fine instep, and her grace
in dancing won the admiration of all. Once, however, she was so
ill-advised as to whip a spaniel that had torn one of her silk
stockings (and it must be said in justice that Favilla had few
stockings and those for the most part of drugget) within an inch of
its life beneath Orlando’s window. Orlando, who was a passionate
lover of animals, now noticed that her teeth were crooked, and the
two front turned inward, which, he said, is a sure sign of a
perverse and cruel disposition in women, and so broke the
engagement that very night for ever.</p>
<p>The third, Euphrosyne, was by far the most serious of his
flames. She was by birth one of the Irish Desmonds and had
therefore a family tree of her own as old and deeply rooted as
Orlando’s itself. She was fair, florid, and a trifle phlegmatic.
She spoke Italian well, had a perfect set of teeth in the upper
jaw, though those on the lower were slightly discoloured. She was
never without a whippet or spaniel at her knee; fed them with white
bread from her own plate; sang sweetly to the virginals; and was
never dressed before mid-day owing to the extreme care she took of
her person. In short, she would have made a perfect wife for such a
nobleman as Orlando, and matters had gone so far that the lawyers
on both sides were busy with covenants, jointures, settlements,
messuages, tenements, and whatever is needed before one great
fortune can mate with another when, with the suddenness and
severity that then marked the English climate, came the Great
Frost.</p>
<p>The Great Frost was, historians tell us, the most severe that
has ever visited these islands. Birds froze in mid-air and fell
like stones to the ground. At Norwich a young countrywoman started
to cross the road in her usual robust health and was seen by the
onlookers to turn visibly to powder and be blown in a puff of dust
over the roofs as the icy blast struck her at the street corner.
The mortality among sheep and cattle was enormous. Corpses froze
and could not be drawn from the sheets. It was no uncommon sight to
come upon a whole herd of swine frozen immovable upon the road. The
fields were full of shepherds, ploughmen, teams of horses, and
little bird-scaring boys all struck stark in the act of the moment,
one with his hand to his nose, another with the bottle to his lips,
a third with a stone raised to throw at the ravens who sat, as if
stuffed, upon the hedge within a yard of him. The severity of the
frost was so extraordinary that a kind of petrifaction sometimes
ensued; and it was commonly supposed that the great increase of
rocks in some parts of Derbyshire was due to no eruption, for there
was none, but to the solidification of unfortunate wayfarers who
had been turned literally to stone where they stood. The Church
could give little help in the matter, and though some landowners
had these relics blessed, the most part preferred to use them
either as landmarks, scratching-posts for sheep, or, when the form
of the stone allowed, drinking troughs for cattle, which purposes
they serve, admirably for the most part, to this day.</p>
<p>But while the country people suffered the extremity of want, and
the trade of the country was at a standstill, London enjoyed a
carnival of the utmost brilliancy. The Court was at Greenwich, and
the new King seized the opportunity that his coronation gave him to
curry favour with the citizens. He directed that the river, which
was frozen to a depth of twenty feet and more for six or seven
miles on either side, should be swept, decorated and given all the
semblance of a park or pleasure ground, with arbours, mazes,
alleys, drinking booths, etc. at his expense. For himself and the
courtiers, he reserved a certain space immediately opposite the
Palace gates; which, railed off from the public only by a silken
rope, became at once the centre of the most brilliant society in
England. Great statesmen, in their beards and ruffs, despatched
affairs of state under the crimson awning of the Royal Pagoda.
Soldiers planned the conquest of the Moor and the downfall of the
Turk in striped arbours surmounted by plumes of ostrich feathers.
Admirals strode up and down the narrow pathways, glass in hand,
sweeping the horizon and telling stories of the north-west passage
and the Spanish Armada. Lovers dallied upon divans spread with
sables. Frozen roses fell in showers when the Queen and her ladies
walked abroad. Coloured balloons hovered motionless in the air.
Here and there burnt vast bonfires of cedar and oak wood, lavishly
salted, so that the flames were of green, orange, and purple fire.
But however fiercely they burnt, the heat was not enough to melt
the ice which, though of singular transparency, was yet of the
hardness of steel. So clear indeed was it that there could be seen,
congealed at a depth of several feet, here a porpoise, there a
flounder. Shoals of eels lay motionless in a trance, but whether
their state was one of death or merely of suspended animation which
the warmth would revive puzzled the philosophers. Near London
Bridge, where the river had frozen to a depth of some twenty
fathoms, a wrecked wherry boat was plainly visible, lying on the
bed of the river where it had sunk last autumn, overladen with
apples. The old bumboat woman, who was carrying her fruit to market
on the Surrey side, sat there in her plaids and farthingales with
her lap full of apples, for all the world as if she were about to
serve a customer, though a certain blueness about the lips hinted
the truth. ‘Twas a sight King James specially liked to look upon,
and he would bring a troupe of courtiers to gaze with him. In
short, nothing could exceed the brilliancy and gaiety of the scene
by day. But it was at night that the carnival was at its merriest.
For the frost continued unbroken; the nights were of perfect
stillness; the moon and stars blazed with the hard fixity of
diamonds, and to the fine music of flute and trumpet the courtiers
danced.</p>
<p>Orlando, it is true, was none of those who tread lightly the
corantoe and lavolta; he was clumsy and a little absentminded. He
much preferred the plain dances of his own country, which he danced
as a child to these fantastic foreign measures. He had indeed just
brought his feet together about six in the evening of the seventh
of January at the finish of some such quadrille or minuet when he
beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a
figure, which, whether boy’s or woman’s, for the loose tunic and
trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled
him with the highest curiosity. The person, whatever the name or
sex, was about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed
entirely in oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar
greenish-coloured fur. But these details were obscured by the
extraordinary seductiveness which issued from the whole person.
Images, metaphors of the most extreme and extravagant twined and
twisted in his mind. He called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive
tree, an emerald, and a fox in the snow all in the space of three
seconds; he did not know whether he had heard her, tasted her, seen
her, or all three together. (For though we must pause not a moment
in the narrative we may here hastily note that all his images at
this time were simple in the extreme to match his senses and were
mostly taken from things he had liked the taste of as a boy. But if
his senses were simple they were at the same time extremely strong.
To pause therefore and seek the reasons of things is out of the
question.)… A melon, an emerald, a fox in the snow — so he raved,
so he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must be — no woman
could skate with such speed and vigour — swept almost on tiptoe
past him, Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that the
person was of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the
question. But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a
boy’s, but no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those
breasts; no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished
from the bottom of the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping
a curtsey with the utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past
on the arm of some Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a
standstill. She was not a handsbreadth off. She was a woman.
Orlando stared; trembled; turned hot; turned cold; longed to hurl
himself through the summer air; to crush acorns beneath his feet;
to toss his arm with the beech trees and the oaks. As it was, he
drew his lips up over his small white teeth; opened them perhaps
half an inch as if to bite; shut them as if he had bitten. The Lady
Euphrosyne hung upon his arm.</p>
<p>The stranger’s name, he found, was the Princess Marousha
Stanilovska Dagmar Natasha Iliana Romanovitch, and she had come in
the train of the Muscovite Ambassador, who was her uncle perhaps,
or perhaps her father, to attend the coronation. Very little was
known of the Muscovites. In their great beards and furred hats they
sat almost silent; drinking some black liquid which they spat out
now and then upon the ice. None spoke English, and French with
which some at least were familiar was then little spoken at the
English Court.</p>
<p>It was through this accident that Orlando and the Princess
became acquainted. They were seated opposite each other at the
great table spread under a huge awning for the entertainment of the
notables. The Princess was placed between two young Lords, one Lord
Francis Vere and the other the young Earl of Moray. It was
laughable to see the predicament she soon had them in, for though
both were fine lads in their way, the babe unborn had as much
knowledge of the French tongue as they had. When at the beginning
of dinner the Princess turned to the Earl and said, with a grace
which ravished his heart, ‘Je crois avoir fait la connaissance d’un
gentilhomme qui vous etait apparente en Pologne l’ete dernier,’ or
‘La beaute des dames de la cour d’Angleterre me met dans le
ravissement. On ne peut voir une dame plus gracieuse que votre
reine, ni une coiffure plus belle que la sienne,’ both Lord Francis
and the Earl showed the highest embarrassment. The one helped her
largely to horse-radish sauce, the other whistled to his dog and
made him beg for a marrow bone. At this the Princess could no
longer contain her laughter, and Orlando, catching her eyes across
the boars’ heads and stuffed peacocks, laughed too. He laughed, but
the laugh on his lips froze in wonder. Whom had he loved, what had
he loved, he asked himself in a tumult of emotion, until now? An
old woman, he answered, all skin and bone. Red-cheeked trulls too
many to mention. A puling nun. A hard-bitten cruel-mouthed
adventuress. A nodding mass of lace and ceremony. Love had meant to
him nothing but sawdust and cinders. The joys he had had of it
tasted insipid in the extreme. He marvelled how he could have gone
through with it without yawning. For as he looked the thickness of
his blood melted; the ice turned to wine in his veins; he heard the
waters flowing and the birds singing; spring broke over the hard
wintry landscape; his manhood woke; he grasped a sword in his hand;
he charged a more daring foe than Pole or Moor; he dived in deep
water; he saw the flower of danger growing in a crevice; he
stretched his hand — in fact he was rattling off one of his most
impassioned sonnets when the Princess addressed him, ‘Would you
have the goodness to pass the salt?’</p>
<p>He blushed deeply.</p>
<p>‘With all the pleasure in the world, Madame,’ he replied,
speaking French with a perfect accent. For, heaven be praised, he
spoke the tongue as his own; his mother’s maid had taught him. Yet
perhaps it would have been better for him had he never learnt that
tongue; never answered that voice; never followed the light of
those eyes…</p>
<p>The Princess continued. Who were those bumpkins, she asked him,
who sat beside her with the manners of stablemen? What was the
nauseating mixture they had poured on her plate? Did the dogs eat
at the same table with the men in England? Was that figure of fun
at the end of the table with her hair rigged up like a Maypole
(comme une grande perche mal fagotee) really the Queen? And did the
King always slobber like that? And which of those popinjays was
George Villiers? Though these questions rather discomposed Orlando
at first, they were put with such archness and drollery that he
could not help but laugh; and he saw from the blank faces of the
company that nobody understood a word, he answered her as freely as
she asked him, speaking, as she did, in perfect French.</p>
<p>Thus began an intimacy between the two which soon became the
scandal of the Court.</p>
<p>Soon it was observed Orlando paid the Muscovite far more
attention than mere civility demanded. He was seldom far from her
side, and their conversation, though unintelligible to the rest,
was carried on with such animation, provoked such blushes and
laughter, that the dullest could guess the subject. Moreover, the
change in Orlando himself was extraordinary. Nobody had ever seen
him so animated. In one night he had thrown off his boyish
clumsiness; he was changed from a sulky stripling, who could not
enter a ladies’ room without sweeping half the ornaments from the
table, to a nobleman, full of grace and manly courtesy. To see him
hand the Muscovite (as she was called) to her sledge, or offer her
his hand for the dance, or catch the spotted kerchief which she had
let drop, or discharge any other of those manifold duties which the
supreme lady exacts and the lover hastens to anticipate was a sight
to kindle the dull eyes of age, and to make the quick pulse of
youth beat faster. Yet over it all hung a cloud. The old men
shrugged their shoulders. The young tittered between their fingers.
All knew that a Orlando was betrothed to another. The Lady Margaret
O’Brien O’Dare O’Reilly Tyrconnel (for that was the proper name of
Euphrosyne of the Sonnets) wore Orlando’s splendid sapphire on the
second finger of her left hand. It was she who had the supreme
right to his attentions. Yet she might drop all the handkerchiefs
in her wardrobe (of which she had many scores) upon the ice and
Orlando never stooped to pick them up. She might wait twenty
minutes for him to hand her to her sledge, and in the end have to
be content with the services of her Blackamoor. When she skated,
which she did rather clumsily, no one was at her elbow to encourage
her, and, if she fell, which she did rather heavily, no one raised
her to her feet and dusted the snow from her petticoats. Although
she was naturally phlegmatic, slow to take offence, and more
reluctant than most people to believe that a mere foreigner could
oust her from Orlando’s affections, still even the Lady Margaret
herself was brought at last to suspect that something was brewing
against her peace of mind.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the days passed, Orlando took less and less care to
hide his feelings. Making some excuse or other, he would leave the
company as soon as they had dined, or steal away from the skaters,
who were forming sets for a quadrille. Next moment it would be seen
that the Muscovite was missing too. But what most outraged the
Court, and stung it in its tenderest part, which is its vanity, was
that the couple was often seen to slip under the silken rope, which
railed off the Royal enclosure from the public part of the river
and to disappear among the crowd of common people. For suddenly the
Princess would stamp her foot and cry, ‘Take me away. I detest your
English mob,’ by which she meant the English Court itself. She
could stand it no longer. It was full of prying old women, she
said, who stared in one’s face, and of bumptious young men who trod
on one’s toes. They smelt bad. Their dogs ran between her legs. It
was like being in a cage. In Russia they had rivers ten miles broad
on which one could gallop six horses abreast all day long without
meeting a soul. Besides, she wanted to see the Tower, the
Beefeaters, the Heads on Temple Bar, and the jewellers’ shops in
the city. Thus, it came about that Orlando took her into the city,
showed her the Beefeaters and the rebels’ heads, and bought her
whatever took her fancy in the Royal Exchange. But this was not
enough. Each increasingly desired the other’s company in privacy
all day long where there were none to marvel or to stare. Instead
of taking the road to London, therefore, they turned the other way
about and were soon beyond the crowd among the frozen reaches of
the Thames where, save for sea birds and some old country woman
hacking at the ice in a vain attempt to draw a pailful of water or
gathering what sticks or dead leaves she could find for firing, not
a living soul ever came their way. The poor kept closely to their
cottages, and the better sort, who could afford it, crowded for
warmth and merriment to the city.</p>
<p>Hence, Orlando and Sasha, as he called her for short, and
because it was the name of a white Russian fox he had had as a boy
— a creature soft as snow, but with teeth of steel, which bit him
so savagely that his father had it killed — hence, they had the
river to themselves. Hot with skating and with love they would
throw themselves down in some solitary reach, where the yellow
osiers fringed the bank, and wrapped in a great fur cloak Orlando
would take her in his arms, and know, for the first time, he
murmured, the delights of love. Then, when the ecstasy was over and
they lay lulled in a swoon on the ice, he would tell her of his
other loves, and how, compared with her, they had been of wood, of
sackcloth, and of cinders. And laughing at his vehemence, she would
turn once more in his arms and give him for love’s sake, one more
embrace. And then they would marvel that the ice did not melt with
their heat, and pity the poor old woman who had no such natural
means of thawing it, but must hack at it with a chopper of cold
steel. And then, wrapped in their sables, they would talk of
everything under the sun; of sights and travels; of Moor and Pagan;
of this man’s beard and that woman’s skin; of a rat that fed from
her hand at table; of the arras that moved always in the hall at
home; of a face; of a feather. Nothing was too small for such
converse, nothing was too great.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, Orlando would fall into one of his moods of
melancholy; the sight of the old woman hobbling over the ice might
be the cause of it, or nothing; and would fling himself face
downwards on the ice and look into the frozen waters and think of
death. For the philosopher is right who says that nothing thicker
than a knife’s blade separates happiness from melancholy; and he
goes on to opine that one is twin fellow to the other; and draws
from this the conclusion that all extremes of feeling are allied to
madness; and so bids us take refuge in the true Church (in his view
the Anabaptist), which is the only harbour, port, anchorage, etc.,
he said, for those tossed on this sea.</p>
<p>‘All ends in death,’ Orlando would say, sitting upright, his
face clouded with gloom. (For that was the way his mind worked now,
in violent see-saws from life to death, stopping at nothing in
between, so that the biographer must not stop either, but must fly
as fast as he can and so keep pace with the unthinking passionate
foolish actions and sudden extravagant words in which, it is
impossible to deny, Orlando at this time of his life indulged.)</p>
<p>‘All ends in death,’ Orlando would say, sitting upright on the
ice. But Sasha who after all had no English blood in her but was
from Russia where the sunsets are longer, the dawns less sudden,
and sentences often left unfinished from doubt as to how best to
end them — Sasha stared at him, perhaps sneered at him, for he must
have seemed a child to her, and said nothing. But at length the ice
grew cold beneath them, which she disliked, so pulling him to his
feet again, she talked so enchantingly, so wittily, so wisely (but
unfortunately always in French, which notoriously loses its flavour
in translation) that he forgot the frozen waters or night coming or
the old woman or whatever it was, and would try to tell her —
plunging and splashing among a thousand images which had gone as
stale as the women who inspired them — what she was like. Snow,
cream, marble, cherries, alabaster, golden wire? None of these. She
was like a fox, or an olive tree; like the waves of the sea when
you look down upon them from a height; like an emerald; like the
sun on a green hill which is yet clouded — like nothing he had seen
or known in England. Ransack the language as he might, words failed
him. He wanted another landscape, and another tongue. English was
too frank, too candid, too honeyed a speech for Sasha. For in all
she said, however open she seemed and voluptuous, there was
something hidden; in all she did, however daring, there was
something concealed. So the green flame seems hidden in the
emerald, or the sun prisoned in a hill. The clearness was only
outward; within was a wandering flame. It came; it went; she never
shone with the steady beam of an Englishwoman — here, however,
remembering the Lady Margaret and her petticoats, Orlando ran wild
in his transports and swept her over the ice, faster, faster,
vowing that he would chase the flame, dive for the gem, and so on
and so on, the words coming on the pants of his breath with the
passion of a poet whose poetry is half pressed out of him by
pain.</p>
<p>But Sasha was silent. When Orlando had done telling her that she
was a fox, an olive tree, or a green hill-top, and had given her
the whole history of his family; how their house was one of the
most ancient in Britain; how they had come from Rome with the
Caesars and had the right to walk down the Corso (which is the
chief street in Rome) under a tasselled palanquin, which he said is
a privilege reserved only for those of imperial blood (for there
was an orgulous credulity about him which was pleasant enough), he
would pause and ask her, Where was her own house? What was her
father? Had she brothers? Why was she here alone with her uncle?
Then, somehow, though she answered readily enough, an awkwardness
would come between them. He suspected at first that her rank was
not as high as she would like; or that she was ashamed of the
savage ways of her people, for he had heard that the women in
Muscovy wear beards and the men are covered with fur from the waist
down; that both sexes are smeared with tallow to keep the cold out,
tear meat with their fingers and live in huts where an English
noble would scruple to keep his cattle; so that he forebore to
press her. But on reflection, he concluded that her silence could
not be for that reason; she herself was entirely free from hair on
the chin; she dressed in velvet and pearls, and her manners were
certainly not those of a woman bred in a cattle-shed.</p>
<p>What, then, did she hide from him? The doubt underlying the
tremendous force of his feelings was like a quicksand beneath a
monument which shifts suddenly and makes the whole pile shake. The
agony would seize him suddenly. Then he would blaze out in such
wrath that she did not know how to quiet him. Perhaps she did not
want to quiet him; perhaps his rages pleased her and she provoked
them purposely — such is the curious obliquity of the Muscovitish
temperament.</p>
<p>To continue the story — skating farther than their wont that day
they reached that part of the river where the ships had anchored
and been frozen in midstream. Among them was the ship of the
Muscovite Embassy flying its double-headed black eagle from the
main mast, which was hung with many-coloured icicles several yards
in length. Sasha had left some of her clothing on board, and
supposing the ship to be empty they climbed on deck and went in
search of it. Remembering certain passages in his own past, Orlando
would not have marvelled had some good citizens sought this refuge
before them; and so it turned out. They had not ventured far when a
fine young man started up from some business of his own behind a
coil of rope and saying, apparently, for he spoke Russian, that he
was one of the crew and would help the Princess to find what she
wanted, lit a lump of candle and disappeared with her into the
lower parts of the ship.</p>
<p>Time went by, and Orlando, wrapped in his own dreams, thought
only of the pleasures of life; of his jewel; of her rarity; of
means for making her irrevocably and indissolubly his own.
Obstacles there were and hardships to overcome. She was determined
to live in Russia, where there were frozen rivers and wild horses
and men, she said, who gashed each other’s throats open. It is true
that a landscape of pine and snow, habits of lust and slaughter,
did not entice him. Nor was he anxious to cease his pleasant
country ways of sport and tree-planting; relinquish his office;
ruin his career; shoot the reindeer instead of the rabbit; drink
vodka instead of canary, and slip a knife up his sleeve — for what
purpose, he knew not. Still, all this and more than all this he
would do for her sake. As for his marriage to the Lady Margaret,
fixed though it was for this day sennight, the thing was so
palpably absurd that he scarcely gave it a thought. Her kinsmen
would abuse him for deserting a great lady; his friends would
deride him for ruining the finest career in the world for a Cossack
woman and a waste of snow — it weighed not a straw in the balance
compared with Sasha herself. On the first dark night they would
fly. They would take ship to Russia. So he pondered; so he plotted
as he walked up and down the deck.</p>
<p>He was recalled, turning westward, by the sight of the sun,
slung like an orange on the cross of St Paul’s. It was blood-red
and sinking rapidly. It must be almost evening. Sasha had been gone
this hour and more. Seized instantly with those dark forebodings
which shadowed even his most confident thoughts of her, he plunged
the way he had seen them go into the hold of the ship; and, after
stumbling among chests and barrels in the darkness, was made aware
by a faint glimmer in a corner that they were seated there. For one
second, he had a vision of them; saw Sasha seated on the sailor’s
knee; saw her bend towards him; saw them embrace before the light
was blotted out in a red cloud by his rage. He blazed into such a
howl of anguish that the whole ship echoed. Sasha threw herself
between them, or the sailor would have been stifled before he could
draw his cutlass. Then a deadly sickness came over Orlando, and
they had to lay him on the floor and give him brandy to drink
before he revived. And then, when he had recovered and was sat upon
a heap of sacking on deck, Sasha hung over him, passing before his
dizzied eyes softly, sinuously, like the fox that had bit him, now
cajoling, now denouncing, so that he came to doubt what he had
seen. Had not the candle guttered; had not the shadows moved? The
box was heavy, she said; the man was helping her to move it.
Orlando believed her one moment — for who can be sure that his rage
has not painted what he most dreads to find? — the next was the
more violent with anger at her deceit. Then Sasha herself turned
white; stamped her foot on deck; said she would go that night, and
called upon her Gods to destroy her, if she, a Romanovitch, had
lain in the arms of a common seaman. Indeed, looking at them
together (which he could hardly bring himself to do) Orlando was
outraged by the foulness of his imagination that could have painted
so frail a creature in the paw of that hairy sea brute. The man was
huge; stood six feet four in his stockings, wore common wire rings
in his ears; and looked like a dray horse upon which some wren or
robin has perched in its flight. So he yielded; believed her; and
asked her pardon. Yet when they were going down the ship’s side,
lovingly again, Sasha paused with her hand on the ladder, and
called back to this tawny wide-cheeked monster a volley of Russian
greetings, jests, or endearments, not a word of which Orlando could
understand. But there was something in her tone (it might be the
fault of the Russian consonants) that reminded Orlando of a scene
some nights since, when he had come upon her in secret gnawing a
candle-end in a corner, which she had picked from the floor. True,
it was pink; it was gilt; and it was from the King’s table; but it
was tallow, and she gnawed it. Was there not, he thought, handing
her on to the ice, something rank in her, something coarse
flavoured, something peasant born? And he fancied her at forty
grown unwieldy though she was now slim as a reed, and lethargic
though she was now blithe as a lark. But again as they skated
towards London such suspicions melted in his breast, and he felt as
if he had been hooked by a great fish through the nose and rushed
through the waters unwillingly, yet with his own consent.</p>
<p>It was an evening of astonishing beauty. As the sun sank, all
the domes, spires, turrets, and pinnacles of London rose in inky
blackness against the furious red sunset clouds. Here was the
fretted cross at Charing; there the dome of St Paul’s; there the
massy square of the Tower buildings; there like a grove of trees
stripped of all leaves save a knob at the end were the heads on the
pikes at Temple Bar. Now the Abbey windows were lit up and burnt
like a heavenly, many-coloured shield (in Orlando’s fancy); now all
the west seemed a golden window with troops of angels (in Orlando’s
fancy again) passing up and down the heavenly stairs perpetually.
All the time they seemed to be skating in fathomless depths of air,
so blue the ice had become; and so glassy smooth was it that they
sped quicker and quicker to the city with the white gulls circling
about them, and cutting in the air with their wings the very same
sweeps that they cut on the ice with their skates.</p>
<p>Sasha, as if to reassure him, was tenderer than usual and even
more delightful. Seldom would she talk about her past life, but now
she told him how, in winter in Russia, she would listen to the
wolves howling across the steppes, and thrice, to show him, she
barked like a wolf. Upon which he told her of the stags in the snow
at home, and how they would stray into the great hall for warmth
and be fed by an old man with porridge from a bucket. And then she
praised him; for his love of beasts; for his gallantry; for his
legs. Ravished with her praises and shamed to think how he had
maligned her by fancying her on the knees of a common sailor and
grown fat and lethargic at forty, he told her that he could find no
words to praise her; yet instantly bethought him how she was like
the spring and green grass and rushing waters, and seizing her more
tightly than ever, he swung her with him half across the river so
that the gulls and the cormorants swung too. And halting at length,
out of breath, she said, panting slightly, that he was like a
million-candled Christmas tree (such as they have in Russia) hung
with yellow globes; incandescent; enough to light a whole street
by; (so one might translate it) for what with his glowing cheeks,
his dark curls, his black and crimson cloak, he looked as if he
were burning with his own radiance, from a lamp lit within.</p>
<p>All the colour, save the red of Orlando’s cheeks, soon faded.
Night came on. As the orange light of sunset vanished it was
succeeded by an astonishing white glare from the torches, bonfires,
flaming cressets, and other devices by which the river was lit up
and the strangest transformation took place. Various churches and
noblemen’s palaces, whose fronts were of white stone showed in
streaks and patches as if floating on the air. Of St Paul’s, in
particular, nothing was left but a gilt cross. The Abbey appeared
like the grey skeleton of a leaf. Everything suffered emaciation
and transformation. As they approached the carnival, they heard a
deep note like that struck on a tuning-fork which boomed louder and
louder until it became an uproar. Every now and then a great shout
followed a rocket into the air. Gradually they could discern little
figures breaking off from the vast crowd and spinning hither and
thither like gnats on the surface of a river. Above and around this
brilliant circle like a bowl of darkness pressed the deep black of
a winter’s night. And then into this darkness there began to rise
with pauses, which kept the expectation alert and the mouth open,
flowering rockets; crescents; serpents; a crown. At one moment the
woods and distant hills showed green as on a summer’s day; the next
all was winter and blackness again.</p>
<p>By this time Orlando and the Princess were close to the Royal
enclosure and found their way barred by a great crowd of the common
people, who were pressing as near to the silken rope as they dared.
Loth to end their privacy and encounter the sharp eyes that were on
the watch for them, the couple lingered there, shouldered by
apprentices; tailors; fishwives; horse dealers, cony catchers;
starving scholars; maid-servants in their whimples; orange girls;
ostlers; sober citizens; bawdy tapsters; and a crowd of little
ragamuffins such as always haunt the outskirts of a crowd,
screaming and scrambling among people’s feet — all the riff-raff of
the London streets indeed was there, jesting and jostling, here
casting dice, telling fortunes, shoving, tickling, pinching; here
uproarious, there glum; some of them with mouths gaping a yard
wide; others as little reverent as daws on a house-top; all as
variously rigged out as their purse or stations allowed; here in
fur and broadcloth; there in tatters with their feet kept from the
ice only by a dishclout bound about them. The main press of people,
it appeared, stood opposite a booth or stage something like our
Punch and Judy show upon which some kind of theatrical performance
was going forward. A black man was waving his arms and
vociferating. There was a woman in white laid upon a bed. Rough
though the staging was, the actors running up and down a pair of
steps and sometimes tripping, and the crowd stamping their feet and
whistling, or when they were bored, tossing a piece of orange peel
on to the ice which a dog would scramble for, still the
astonishing, sinuous melody of the words stirred Orlando like
music. Spoken with extreme speed and a daring agility of tongue
which reminded him of the sailors singing in the beer gardens at
Wapping, the words even without meaning were as wine to him. But
now and again a single phrase would come to him over the ice which
was as if torn from the depths of his heart. The frenzy of the Moor
seemed to him his own frenzy, and when the Moor suffocated the
woman in her bed it was Sasha he killed with his own hands.</p>
<p>At last the play was ended. All had grown dark. The tears
streamed down his face. Looking up into the sky there was nothing
but blackness there too. Ruin and death, he thought, cover all. The
life of man ends in the grave. Worms devour us.</p>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</p>
<p>Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe</p>
<p>Should yawn&#160;—</p>
</div>
<p>Even as he said this a star of some pallor rose in his memory.
The night was dark; it was pitch dark; but it was such a night as
this that they had waited for; it was on such a night as this that
they had planned to fly. He remembered everything. The time had
come. With a burst of passion he snatched Sasha to him, and hissed
in her ear ‘Jour de ma vie!’ It was their signal. At midnight they
would meet at an inn near Blackfriars. Horses waited there.
Everything was in readiness for their flight. So they parted, she
to her tent, he to his. It still wanted an hour of the time.</p>
<p>Long before midnight Orlando was in waiting. The night was of so
inky a blackness that a man was on you before he could be seen,
which was all to the good, but it was also of the most solemn
stillness so that a horse’s hoof, or a child’s cry, could be heard
at a distance of half a mile. Many a time did Orlando, pacing the
little courtyard, hold his heart at the sound of some nag’s steady
footfall on the cobbles, or at the rustle of a woman’s dress. But
the traveller was only some merchant, making home belated; or some
woman of the quarter whose errand was nothing so innocent. They
passed, and the street was quieter than before. Then those lights
which burnt downstairs in the small, huddled quarters where the
poor of the city lived moved up to the sleeping-rooms, and then,
one by one, were extinguished. The street lanterns in these
purlieus were few at most; and the negligence of the night watchman
often suffered them to expire long before dawn. The darkness then
became even deeper than before. Orlando looked to the wicks of his
lantern, saw to the saddle girths; primed his pistols; examined his
holsters; and did all these things a dozen times at least till he
could find nothing more needing his attention. Though it still
lacked some twenty minutes to midnight, he could not bring himself
to go indoors to the inn parlour, where the hostess was still
serving sack and the cheaper sort of canary wine to a few seafaring
men, who would sit there trolling their ditties, and telling their
stories of Drake, Hawkins, and Grenville, till they toppled off the
benches and rolled asleep on the sanded floor. The darkness was
more compassionate to his swollen and violent heart. He listened to
every footfall; speculated on every sound. Each drunken shout and
each wail from some poor wretch laid in the straw or in other
distress cut his heart to the quick, as if it boded ill omen to his
venture. Yet, he had no fear for Sasha. Her courage made nothing of
the adventure. She would come alone, in her cloak and trousers,
booted like a man. Light as her footfall was, it would hardly be
heard, even in this silence.</p>
<p>So he waited in the darkness. Suddenly he was struck in the face
by a blow, soft, yet heavy, on the side of his cheek. So strung
with expectation was he, that he started and put his hand to his
sword. The blow was repeated a dozen times on forehead and cheek.
The dry frost had lasted so long that it took him a minute to
realize that these were raindrops falling; the blows were the blows
of the rain. At first, they fell slowly, deliberately, one by one.
But soon the six drops became sixty; then six hundred; then ran
themselves together in a steady spout of water. It was as if the
hard and consolidated sky poured itself forth in one profuse
fountain. In the space of five minutes Orlando was soaked to the
skin.</p>
<p>Hastily putting the horses under cover, he sought shelter
beneath the lintel of the door whence he could still observe the
courtyard. The air was thicker now than ever, and such a steaming
and droning rose from the downpour that no footfall of man or beast
could be heard above it. The roads, pitted as they were with great
holes, would be under water and perhaps impassable. But of what
effect this would have upon their flight he scarcely thought. All
his senses were bent upon gazing along the cobbled pathway —
gleaming in the light of the lantern — for Sasha’s coming.
Sometimes, in the darkness, he seemed to see her wrapped about with
rain strokes. But the phantom vanished. Suddenly, with an awful and
ominous voice, a voice full of horror and alarm which raised every
hair of anguish in Orlando’s soul, St Paul’s struck the first
stroke of midnight. Four times more it struck remorselessly. With
the superstition of a lover, Orlando had made out that it was on
the sixth stroke that she would come. But the sixth stroke echoed
away, and the seventh came and the eighth, and to his apprehensive
mind they seemed notes first heralding and then proclaiming death
and disaster. When the twelfth struck he knew that his doom was
sealed. It was useless for the rational part of him to reason; she
might be late; she might be prevented; she might have missed her
way. The passionate and feeling heart of Orlando knew the truth.
Other clocks struck, jangling one after another. The whole world
seemed to ring with the news of her deceit and his derision. The
old suspicions subterraneously at work in him rushed forth from
concealment openly. He was bitten by a swarm of snakes, each more
poisonous than the last. He stood in the doorway in the tremendous
rain without moving. As the minutes passed, he sagged a little at
the knees. The downpour rushed on. In the thick of it, great guns
seemed to boom. Huge noises as of the tearing and rending of oak
trees could be heard. There were also wild cries and terrible
inhuman groanings. But Orlando stood there immovable till Paul’s
clock struck two, and then, crying aloud with an awful irony, and
all his teeth showing, ‘Jour de ma vie!’ he dashed the lantern to
the ground, mounted his horse and galloped he knew not where.</p>
<p>Some blind instinct, for he was past reasoning, must have driven
him to take the river bank in the direction of the sea. For when
the dawn broke, which it did with unusual suddenness, the sky
turning a pale yellow and the rain almost ceasing, he found himself
on the banks of the Thames off Wapping. Now a sight of the most
extraordinary nature met his eyes. Where, for three months and
more, there had been solid ice of such thickness that it seemed
permanent as stone, and a whole gay city had been stood on its
pavement, was now a race of turbulent yellow waters. The river had
gained its freedom in the night. It was as if a sulphur spring (to
which view many philosophers inclined) had risen from the volcanic
regions beneath and burst the ice asunder with such vehemence that
it swept the huge and massy fragments furiously apart. The mere
look of the water was enough to turn one giddy. All was riot and
confusion. The river was strewn with icebergs. Some of these were
as broad as a bowling green and as high as a house; others no
bigger than a man’s hat, but most fantastically twisted. Now would
come down a whole convoy of ice blocks sinking everything that
stood in their way. Now, eddying and swirling like a tortured
serpent, the river would seem to be hurtling itself between the
fragments and tossing them from bank to bank, so that they could be
heard smashing against the piers and pillars. But what was the most
awful and inspiring of terror was the sight of the human creatures
who had been trapped in the night and now paced their twisting and
precarious islands in the utmost agony of spirit. Whether they
jumped into the flood or stayed on the ice their doom was certain.
Sometimes quite a cluster of these poor creatures would come down
together, some on their knees, others suckling their babies. One
old man seemed to be reading aloud from a holy book. At other
times, and his fate perhaps was the most dreadful, a solitary
wretch would stride his narrow tenement alone. As they swept out to
sea, some could be heard crying vainly for help, making wild
promises to amend their ways, confessing their sins and vowing
altars and wealth if God would hear their prayers. Others were so
dazed with terror that they sat immovable and silent looking
steadfastly before them. One crew of young watermen or post-boys,
to judge by their liveries, roared and shouted the lewdest tavern
songs, as if in bravado, and were dashed against a tree and sunk
with blasphemies on their lips. An old nobleman — for such his
furred gown and golden chain proclaimed him — went down not far
from where Orlando stood, calling vengeance upon the Irish rebels,
who, he cried with his last breath, had plotted this devilry. Many
perished clasping some silver pot or other treasure to their
breasts; and at least a score of poor wretches were drowned by
their own cupidity, hurling themselves from the bank into the flood
rather than let a gold goblet escape them, or see before their eyes
the disappearance of some furred gown. For furniture, valuables,
possessions of all sorts were carried away on the icebergs. Among
other strange sights was to be seen a cat suckling its young; a
table laid sumptuously for a supper of twenty; a couple in bed;
together with an extraordinary number of cooking utensils.</p>
<p>Dazed and astounded, Orlando could do nothing for some time but
watch the appalling race of waters as it hurled itself past him. At
last, seeming to recollect himself, he clapped spurs to his horse
and galloped hard along the river bank in the direction of the sea.
Rounding a bend of the river, he came opposite that reach where,
not two days ago, the ships of the Ambassadors had seemed immovably
frozen. Hastily, he made count of them all; the French; the
Spanish; the Austrian; the Turk. All still floated, though the
French had broken loose from her moorings, and the Turkish vessel
had taken a great rent in her side and was fast filling with water.
But the Russian ship was nowhere to be seen. For one moment Orlando
thought it must have foundered; but, raising himself in his
stirrups and shading his eyes, which had the sight of a hawk’s, he
could just make out the shape of a ship on the horizon. The black
eagles were flying from the mast head. The ship of the Muscovite
Embassy was standing out to sea.</p>
<p>Flinging himself from his horse, he made, in his rage, as if he
would breast the flood. Standing knee-deep in water he hurled at
the faithless woman all the insults that have ever been the lot of
her sex. Faithless, mutable, fickle, he called her; devil,
adulteress, deceiver; and the swirling waters took his words, and
tossed at his feet a broken pot and a little straw.</p>
