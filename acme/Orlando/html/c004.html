<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
</div>

<p>With some of the guineas left
from the sale of the tenth pearl on her string, Orlando bought
herself a complete outfit of such clothes as women then wore, and
it was in the dress of a young Englishwoman of rank that she now
sat on the deck of the “Enamoured Lady”. It is a strange fact, but
a true one, that up to this moment she had scarcely given her sex a
thought. Perhaps the Turkish trousers which she had hitherto worn
had done something to distract her thoughts; and the gipsy women,
except in one or two important particulars, differ very little from
the gipsy men. At any rate, it was not until she felt the coil of
skirts about her legs and the Captain offered, with the greatest
politeness, to have an awning spread for her on deck, that she
realized with a start the penalties and the privileges of her
position. But that start was not of the kind that might have been
expected.</p>
<p>It was not caused, that is to say, simply and solely by the
thought of her chastity and how she could preserve it. In normal
circumstances a lovely young woman alone would have thought of
nothing else; the whole edifice of female government is based on
that foundation stone; chastity is their jewel, their centrepiece,
which they run mad to protect, and die when ravished of. But if one
has been a man for thirty years or so, and an Ambassador into the
bargain, if one has held a Queen in one’s arms and one or two other
ladies, if report be true, of less exalted rank, if one has married
a Rosina Pepita, and so on, one does not perhaps give such a very
great start about that. Orlando’s start was of a very complicated
kind, and not to be summed up in a trice. Nobody, indeed, ever
accused her of being one of those quick wits who run to the end of
things in a minute. It took her the entire length of the voyage to
moralize out the meaning of her start, and so, at her own pace, we
will follow her.</p>
<p>‘Lord,’ she thought, when she had recovered from her start,
stretching herself out at length under her awning, ‘this is a
pleasant, lazy way of life, to be sure. But,’ she thought, giving
her legs a kick, ‘these skirts are plaguey things to have about
one’s heels. Yet the stuff (flowered paduasoy) is the loveliest in
the world. Never have I seen my own skin (here she laid her hand on
her knee) look to such advantage as now. Could I, however, leap
overboard and swim in clothes like these? No! Therefore, I should
have to trust to the protection of a blue-jacket. Do I object to
that? Now do I?’ she wondered, here encountering the first knot in
the smooth skein of her argument.</p>
<p>Dinner came before she had untied it, and then it was the
Captain himself — Captain Nicholas Benedict Bartolus, a sea-captain
of distinguished aspect, who did it for her as he helped her to a
slice of corned beef.</p>
<p>‘A little of the fat, Ma’m?’ he asked. ‘Let me cut you just the
tiniest little slice the size of your fingernail.’ At those words a
delicious tremor ran through her frame. Birds sang; the torrents
rushed. It recalled the feeling of indescribable pleasure with
which she had first seen Sasha, hundreds of years ago. Then she had
pursued, now she fled. Which is the greater ecstasy? The man’s or
the woman’s? And are they not perhaps the same? No, she thought,
this is the most delicious (thanking the Captain but refusing), to
refuse, and see him frown. Well, she would, if he wished it, have
the very thinnest, smallest shiver in the world. This was the most
delicious of all, to yield and see him smile. ‘For nothing,’ she
thought, regaining her couch on deck, and continuing the argument,
‘is more heavenly than to resist and to yield; to yield and to
resist. Surely it throws the spirit into such a rapture as nothing
else can. So that I’m not sure’, she continued, ‘that I won’t throw
myself overboard, for the mere pleasure of being rescued by a
blue-jacket after all.’</p>
<p>(It must be remembered that she was like a child entering into
possession of a pleasaunce or toy cupboard; her arguments would not
commend themselves to mature women, who have had the run of it all
their lives.)</p>
<p>‘But what used we young fellows in the cockpit of the “Marie
Rose” to say about a woman who threw herself overboard for the
pleasure of being rescued by a blue-jacket?’ she said. ‘We had a
word for them. Ah! I have it… ’ (But we must omit that word; it was
disrespectful in the extreme and passing strange on a lady’s lips.)
‘Lord! Lord! she cried again at the conclusion of her thoughts,
‘must I then begin to respect the opinion of the other sex, however
monstrous I think it? If I wear skirts, if I can’t swim, if I have
to be rescued by a blue-jacket, by God!’ she cried, ‘I must!’ Upon
which a gloom fell over her. Candid by nature, and averse to all
kinds of equivocation, to tell lies bored her. It seemed to her a
roundabout way of going to work. Yet, she reflected, the flowered
paduasoy — the pleasure of being rescued by a blue-jacket — if
these were only to be obtained by roundabout ways, roundabout one
must go, she supposed. She remembered how, as a young man, she had
insisted that women must be obedient, chaste, scented, and
exquisitely apparelled. ‘Now I shall have to pay in my own person
for those desires,’ she reflected; ‘for women are not (judging by
my own short experience of the sex) obedient, chaste, scented, and
exquisitely apparelled by nature. They can only attain these
graces, without which they may enjoy none of the delights of life,
by the most tedious discipline. There’s the hairdressing,’ she
thought, ‘that alone will take an hour of my morning, there’s
looking in the looking-glass, another hour; there’s staying and
lacing; there’s washing and powdering; there’s changing from silk
to lace and from lace to paduasoy; there’s being chaste year in
year out… ’ Here she tossed her foot impatiently, and showed an
inch or two of calf. A sailor on the mast, who happened to look
down at the moment, started so violently that he missed his footing
and only saved himself by the skin of his teeth. ‘If the sight of
my ankles means death to an honest fellow who, no doubt, has a wife
and family to support, I must, in all humanity, keep them covered,’
Orlando thought. Yet her legs were among her chiefest beauties. And
she fell to thinking what an odd pass we have come to when all a
woman’s beauty has to be kept covered lest a sailor may fall from a
mast-head. ‘A pox on them!’ she said, realizing for the first time
what, in other circumstances, she would have been taught as a
child, that is to say, the sacred responsibilities of
womanhood.</p>
<p>@’And that’s the last oath I shall ever be able to swear,’ she
thought; ‘once I set foot on English soil. And I shall never be
able to crack a man over the head, or tell him he lies in his
teeth, or draw my sword and run him through the body, or sit among
my peers, or wear a coronet, or walk in procession, or sentence a
man to death, or lead an army, or prance down Whitehall on a
charger, or wear seventy-two different medals on my breast. All I
can do, once I set foot on English soil, is to pour out tea and ask
my lords how they like it. D’you take sugar? D’you take cream?’ And
mincing out the words, she was horrified to perceive how low an
opinion she was forming of the other sex, the manly, to which it
had once been her pride to belong —’To fall from a mast-head’, she
thought, ‘because you see a woman’s ankles; to dress up like a Guy
Fawkes and parade the streets, so that women may praise you; to
deny a woman teaching lest she may laugh at you; to be the slave of
the frailest chit in petticoats. and yet to go about as if you were
the Lords of creation. — Heavens!’ she thought, ‘what fools they
make of us — what fools we are!’ And here it would seem from some
ambiguity in her terms that she was censuring both sexes equally,
as if she belonged to neither; and indeed, for the time being, she
seemed to vacillate; she was man; she was woman; she knew the
secrets, shared the weaknesses of each. It was a most bewildering
and whirligig state of mind to be in. The comforts of ignorance
seemed utterly denied her. She was a feather blown on the gale.
Thus it is no great wonder, as she pitted one sex against the
other, and found each alternately full of the most deplorable
infirmities, and was not sure to which she belonged — it was no
great wonder that she was about to cry out that she would return to
Turkey and become a gipsy again when the anchor fell with a great
splash into the sea; the sails came tumbling on deck, and she
perceived (so sunk had she been in thought that she had seen
nothing for several days) that the ship was anchored off the coast
of Italy. The Captain at once sent to ask the honour of her company
ashore with him in the longboat.</p>
<p>When she returned the next morning, she stretched herself on her
couch under the awning and arranged her draperies with the greatest
decorum about her ankles.</p>
<p>‘Ignorant and poor as we are compared with the other sex,’ she
thought, continuing the sentence which she had left unfinished the
other day, ‘armoured with every weapon as they are, while they
debar us even from a knowledge of the alphabet’ (and from these
opening words it is plain that something had happened during the
night to give her a push towards the female sex, for she was
speaking more as a woman speaks than as a man, yet with a sort of
content after all), ‘still — they fall from the mast-head.’ Here
she gave a great yawn and fell asleep. When she woke, the ship was
sailing before a fair breeze so near the shore that towns on the
cliffs’ edge seemed only kept from slipping into the water by the
interposition of some great rock or the twisted roots of some
ancient olive tree. The scent of oranges wafted from a million
trees, heavy with the fruit, reached her on deck. A score of blue
dolphins, twisting their tails, leapt high now and again into the
air. Stretching her arms out (arms, she had learnt already, have no
such fatal effects as legs), she thanked Heaven that she was not
prancing down Whitehall on a warhorse, nor even sentencing a man to
death. ‘Better is it’, she thought, ‘to be clothed with poverty and
ignorance, which are the dark garments of the female sex; better to
leave the rule and discipline of the world to others; better be
quit of martial ambition, the love of power, and all the other
manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted
raptures known to the humane spirit, which are’, she said aloud, as
her habit was when deeply moved, ‘contemplation, solitude,
love.’</p>
<p>‘Praise God that I’m a woman!’ she cried, and was about to run
into extreme folly — than which none is more distressing in woman
or man either — of being proud of her sex, when she paused over the
singular word, which, for all we can do to put it in its place, has
crept in at the end of the last sentence: Love. ‘Love,’ said
Orlando. Instantly — such is its impetuosity — love took a human
shape — such is its pride. For where other thoughts are content to
remain abstract, nothing will satisfy this one but to put on flesh
and blood, mantilla and petticoats, hose and jerkin. And as all
Orlando’s loves had been women, now, through the culpable laggardry
of the human frame to adapt itself to convention, though she
herself was a woman, it was still a woman she loved; and if the
consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all, it
was to quicken and deepen those feelings which she had had as a
man. For now a thousand hints and mysteries became plain to her
that were then dark. Now, the obscurity, which divides the sexes
and lets linger innumerable impurities in its gloom, was removed,
and if there is anything in what the poet says about truth and
beauty, this affection gained in beauty what it lost in falsity. At
last, she cried, she knew Sasha as she was, and in the ardour of
this discovery, and in the pursuit of all those treasures which
were now revealed, she was so rapt and enchanted that it was as if
a cannon ball had exploded at her ear when a man’s voice said,
‘Permit me, Madam,’ a man’s hand raised her to her feet; and the
fingers of a man with a three-masted sailing ship tattooed on the
middle finger pointed to the horizon.</p>
<p>‘The cliffs of England, Ma’am,’ said the Captain, and he raised
the hand which had pointed at the sky to the salute. Orlando now
gave a second start, even more violent than the first.</p>
<p>‘Christ Jesus!’ she cried.</p>
<p>Happily, the sight of her native land after long absence excused
both start and exclamation, or she would have been hard put to it
to explain to Captain Bartolus the raging and conflicting emotions
which now boiled within her. How tell him that she, who now
trembled on his arm, had been a Duke and an Ambassador? How explain
to him that she, who had been lapped like a lily in folds of
paduasoy, had hacked heads off, and lain with loose women among
treasure sacks in the holds of pirate ships on summer nights when
the tulips were abloom and the bees buzzing off Wapping Old Stairs?
Not even to herself could she explain the giant start she gave, as
the resolute right hand of the sea-captain indicated the cliffs of
the British Islands.</p>
<p>‘To refuse and to yield,’ she murmured, ‘how delightful; to
pursue and conquer, how august; to perceive and to reason, how
sublime.’ Not one of these words so coupled together seemed to her
wrong; nevertheless, as the chalky cliffs loomed nearer, she felt
culpable; dishonoured; unchaste, which, for one who had never given
the matter a thought, was strange. Closer and closer they drew,
till the samphire gatherers, hanging half-way down the cliff, were
plain to the naked eye. And watching them, she felt, scampering up
and down within her, like some derisive ghost who in another
instant will pick up her skirts and flaunt out of sight, Sasha the
lost, Sasha the memory, whose reality she had proved just now so
surprisingly — Sasha, she felt, mopping and mowing and making all
sorts of disrespectful gestures towards the cliffs and the samphire
gatherers; and when the sailors began chanting, ‘So good-bye and
adieu to you, Ladies of Spain’, the words echoed in Orlando’s sad
heart, and she felt that however much landing there meant comfort,
meant opulence, meant consequence and state (for she would
doubtless pick up some noble Prince and reign, his consort, over
half Yorkshire), still, if it meant conventionality, meant slavery,
meant deceit, meant denying her love, fettering her limbs, pursing
her lips, and restraining her tongue, then she would turn about
with the ship and set sail once more for the gipsies.</p>
<p>Among the hurry of these thoughts, however, there now rose, like
a dome of smooth, white marble, something which, whether fact or
fancy, was so impressive to her fevered imagination that she
settled upon it as one has seen a swarm of vibrant dragonflies
alight, with apparent satisfaction, upon the glass bell which
shelters some tender vegetable. The form of it, by the hazard of
fancy, recalled that earliest, most persistent memory — the man
with the big forehead in Twitchett’s sitting-room, the man who sat
writing, or rather looking, but certainly not at her, for he never
seemed to see her poised there in all her finery, lovely boy though
she must have been, she could not deny it — and whenever she
thought of him, the thought spread round it, like the risen moon on
turbulent waters, a sheet of silver calm. Now her hand went to her
bosom (the other was still in the Captain’s keeping), where the
pages of her poem were hidden safe. It might have been a talisman
that she kept there. The distraction of sex, which hers was, and
what it meant, subsided; she thought now only of the glory of
poetry, and the great lines of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson,
Milton began booming and reverberating, as if a golden clapper beat
against a golden bell in the cathedral tower which was her mind.
The truth was that the image of the marble dome which her eyes had
first discovered so faintly that it suggested a poet’s forehead and
thus started a flock of irrelevant ideas, was no figment, but a
reality; and as the ship advanced down the Thames before a
favouring gale, the image with all its associations gave place to
the truth, and revealed itself as nothing more and nothing less
than the dome of a vast cathedral rising among a fretwork of white
spires.</p>
<p>‘St Paul’s,’ said Captain Bartolus, who stood by her side. ‘The
Tower of London,’ he continued. ‘Greenwich Hospital, erected in
memory of Queen Mary by her husband, his late majesty, William the
Third. Westminster Abbey. The Houses of Parliament.’ As he spoke,
each of these famous buildings rose to view. It was a fine
September morning. A myriad of little water-craft plied from bank
to bank. Rarely has a gayer, or more interesting, spectacle
presented itself to the gaze of a returned traveller. Orlando hung
over the prow, absorbed in wonder. Her eyes had been used too long
to savages and nature not to be entranced by these urban glories.
That, then, was the dome of St Paul’s which Mr Wren had built
during her absence. Near by, a shock of golden hair burst from a
pillar — Captain Bartolus was at her side to inform her that that
was the Monument; there had been a plague and a fire during her
absence, he said. Do what she could to restrain them, the tears
came to her eyes, until, remembering that it is becoming in a woman
to weep, she let them flow. Here, she thought, had been the great
carnival. Here, where the waves slapped briskly, had stood the
Royal Pavilion. Here she had first met Sasha. About here (she
looked down into the sparkling waters) one had been used to see the
frozen bumboat woman with her apples on her lap. All that splendour
and corruption was gone. Gone, too, was the dark night, the
monstrous downpour, the violent surges of the flood. Here, where
yellow icebergs had raced circling with a crew of terror-stricken
wretches on top, a covey of swans floated, orgulous, undulant,
superb. London itself had completely changed since she had last
seen it. Then, she remembered, it had been a huddle of little
black, beetle-browed houses. The heads of rebels had grinned on
pikes at Temple Bar. The cobbled pavements had reeked of garbage
and ordure. Now, as the ship sailed past Wapping, she caught
glimpses of broad and orderly thoroughfares. Stately coaches drawn
by teams of well-fed horses stood at the doors of houses whose bow
windows, whose plate glass, whose polished knockers, testified to
the wealth and modest dignity of the dwellers within. Ladies in
flowered silk (she put the Captain’s glass to her eye) walked on
raised footpaths. Citizens in broidered coats took snuff at street
corners under lamp-posts. She caught sight of a variety of painted
signs swinging in the breeze and could form a rapid notion from
what was painted on them of the tobacco, of the stuff, of the silk,
of the gold, of the silver ware, of the gloves, of the perfumes,
and of a thousand other articles which were sold within. Nor could
she do more as the ship sailed to its anchorage by London Bridge
than glance at coffee-house windows where, on balconies, since the
weather was fine, a great number of decent citizens sat at ease,
with china dishes in front of them, clay pipes by their sides,
while one among them read from a news sheet, and was frequently
interrupted by the laughter or the comments of the others. Were
these taverns, were these wits, were these poets? she asked of
Captain Bartolus, who obligingly informed her that even now — if
she turned her head a little to the left and looked along the line
of his first finger — so — they were passing the Cocoa Tree, where
— yes, there he was — one might see Mr Addison taking his coffee;
the other two gentlemen —’there, Ma’am, a little to the right of
the lamp-post, one of ‘em humped, t’other much the same as you or
me’— were Mr Dryden and Mr Pope.’ ‘Sad dogs,’ said the Captain, by
which he meant that they were Papists, ‘but men of parts, none the
less,’ he added, hurrying aft to superintend the arrangements for
landing. (The Captain must have been mistaken, as a reference to
any textbook of literature will show; but the mistake was a kindly
one, and so we let it stand.)</p>
<p>‘Addison, Dryden, Pope,’ Orlando repeated as if the words were
an incantation. For one moment she saw the high mountains above
Broussa, the next, she had set her foot upon her native shore.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p>But now Orlando was to learn how little the most tempestuous
flutter of excitement avails against the iron countenance of the
law; how harder than the stones of London Bridge it is, and than
the lips of a cannon more severe. No sooner had she returned to her
home in Blackfriars than she was made aware by a succession of Bow
Street runners and other grave emissaries from the Law Courts that
she was a party to three major suits which had been preferred
against her during her absence, as well as innumerable minor
litigations, some arising out of, others depending on them. The
chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead, and therefore
could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman,
which amounts to much the same thing; (3) that she was an English
Duke who had married one Rosina Pepita, a dancer; and had had by
her three sons, which sons now declaring that their father was
deceased, claimed that all his property descended to them. Such
grave charges as these would, of course, take time and money to
dispose of. All her estates were put in Chancery and her titles
pronounced in abeyance while the suits were under litigation. Thus
it was in a highly ambiguous condition, uncertain whether she was
alive or dead, man or woman, Duke or nonentity, that she posted
down to her country seat, where, pending the legal judgment, she
had the Law’s permission to reside in a state of incognito or
incognita, as the case might turn out to be.</p>
<p>It was a fine evening in December when she arrived and the snow
was falling and the violet shadows were slanting much as she had
seen them from the hill-top at Broussa. The great house lay more
like a town than a house, brown and blue, rose and purple in the
snow, with all its chimneys smoking busily as if inspired with a
life of their own. She could not restrain a cry as she saw it there
tranquil and massive, couched upon the meadows. As the yellow coach
entered the park and came bowling along the drive between the
trees, the red deer raised their heads as if expectantly, and it
was observed that instead of showing the timidity natural to their
kind, they followed the coach and stood about the courtyard when it
drew up. Some tossed their antlers, others pawed the ground as the
step was let down and Orlando alighted. One, it is said, actually
knelt in the snow before her. She had not time to reach her hand
towards the knocker before both wings of the great door were flung
open, and there, with lights and torches held above their heads,
were Mrs Grimsditch, Mr Dupper, and a whole retinue of servants
come to greet her. But the orderly procession was interrupted first
by the impetuosity of Canute, the elk-hound, who threw himself with
such ardour upon his mistress that he almost knocked her to the
ground; next, by the agitation of Mrs Grimsditch, who, making as if
to curtsey, was overcome with emotion and could do no more than
gasp Milord! Milady! Milady! Milord! until Orlando comforted her
with a hearty kiss upon both her cheeks. After that, Mr Dupper
began to read from a parchment, but the dogs barking, the huntsmen
winding their horns, and the stags, who had come into the courtyard
in the confusion, baying the moon, not much progress was made, and
the company dispersed within after crowding about their Mistress,
and testifying in every way to their great joy at her return.</p>
<p>No one showed an instant’s suspicion that Orlando was not the
Orlando they had known. If any doubt there was in the human mind
the action of the deer and the dogs would have been enough to
dispel it, for the dumb creatures, as is well known, are far better
judges both of identity and character than we are. Moreover, said
Mrs Grimsditch, over her dish of china tea, to Mr Dupper that
night, if her Lord was a Lady now, she had never seen a lovelier
one, nor was there a penny piece to choose between them; one was as
well-favoured as the other; they were as like as two peaches on one
branch; which, said Mrs Grimsditch, becoming confidential, she had
always had her suspicions (here she nodded her head very
mysteriously), which it was no surprise to her (here she nodded her
head very knowingly), and for her part, a very great comfort; for
what with the towels wanting mending and the curtains in the
chaplain’s parlour being moth-eaten round the fringes, it was time
they had a Mistress among them.</p>
<p>‘And some little masters and mistresses to come after her,’ Mr
Dupper added, being privileged by virtue of his holy office to
speak his mind on such delicate matters as these.</p>
<p>So, while the old servants gossiped in the servants’ hall,
Orlando took a silver candle in her hand and roamed once more
through the halls, the galleries, the courts, the bedrooms; saw
loom down at her again the dark visage of this Lord Keeper, that
Lord Chamberlain, among her ancestors; sat now in this chair of
state, now reclined on that canopy of delight; observed the arras,
how it swayed; watched the huntsmen riding and Daphne flying;
bathed her hand, as she had loved to do as a child, in the yellow
pool of light which the moonlight made falling through the heraldic
Leopard in the window; slid along the polished planks of the
gallery, the other side of which was rough timber; touched this
silk, that satin; fancied the carved dolphins swam; brushed her
hair with King James’ silver brush; buried her face in the
potpourri, which was made as the Conqueror had taught them many
hundred years ago and from the same roses; looked at the garden and
imagined the sleeping crocuses, the dormant dahlias; saw the frail
nymphs gleaming white in the snow and the great yew hedges, thick
as a house, black behind them; saw the orangeries and the giant
medlars; — all this she saw, and each sight and sound, rudely as we
write it down, filled her heart with such a lust and balm of joy,
that at length, tired out, she entered the Chapel and sank into the
old red arm-chair in which her ancestors used to hear service.
There she lit a cheroot (’twas a habit she had brought back from
the East) and opened the Prayer Book.</p>
<p>It was a little book bound in velvet, stitched with gold, which
had been held by Mary Queen of Scots on the scaffold, and the eye
of faith could detect a brownish stain, said to be made of a drop
of the Royal blood. But what pious thoughts it roused in Orlando,
what evil passions it soothed asleep, who dare say, seeing that of
all communions this with the deity is the most inscrutable?
Novelist, poet, historian all falter with their hand on that door;
nor does the believer himself enlighten us, for is he more ready to
die than other people, or more eager to share his goods? Does he
not keep as many maids and carriage horses as the rest? and yet
with it all, holds a faith he says which should make goods a vanity
and death desirable. In the Queen’s prayerbook, along with the
blood-stain, was also a lock of hair and a crumb of pastry; Orlando
now added to these keepsakes a flake of tobacco, and so, reading
and smoking, was moved by the humane jumble of them all — the hair,
the pastry, the blood-stain, the tobacco — to such a mood of
contemplation as gave her a reverent air suitable in the
circumstances, though she had, it is said, no traffic with the
usual God. Nothing, however, can be more arrogant, though nothing
is commoner than to assume that of Gods there is only one, and of
religions none but the speaker’s. Orlando, it seemed, had a faith
of her own. With all the religious ardour in the world, she now
reflected upon her sins and the imperfections that had crept into
her spiritual state. The letter S, she reflected, is the serpent in
the poet’s Eden. Do what she would there were still too many of
these sinful reptiles in the first stanzas of ‘The Oak Tree’. But
‘S’ was nothing, in her opinion, compared with the termination
‘ing’. The present participle is the Devil himself, she thought,
now that we are in the place for believing in Devils. To evade such
temptations is the first duty of the poet, she concluded, for as
the ear is the antechamber to the soul, poetry can adulterate and
destroy more surely than lust or gunpowder. The poet’s, then, is
the highest office of all, she continued. His words reach where
others fall short. A silly song of Shakespeare’s has done more for
the poor and the wicked than all the preachers and philanthropists
in the world. No time, no devotion, can be too great, therefore,
which makes the vehicle of our message less distorting. We must
shape our words till they are the thinnest integument for our
thoughts. Thoughts are divine, etc. Thus it is obvious that she was
back in the confines of her own religion which time had only
strengthened in her absence, and was rapidly acquiring the
intolerance of belief.</p>
<p>‘I am growing up,’ she thought, taking her taper at last. ‘I am
losing some illusions,’ she said, shutting Queen Mary’s book,
‘perhaps to acquire others,’ and she descended among the tombs
where the bones of her ancestors lay.</p>
<p>But even the bones of her ancestors, Sir Miles, Sir Gervase, and
the rest, had lost something of their sanctity since Rustum el Sadi
had waved his hand that night in the Asian mountains. Somehow the
fact that only three or four hundred years ago these skeletons had
been men with their way to make in the world like any modern
upstart, and that they had made it by acquiring houses and offices,
garters and ribbands, as any other upstart does, while poets,
perhaps, and men of great mind and breeding had preferred the
quietude of the country, for which choice they paid the penalty by
extreme poverty, and now hawked broadsheets in the Strand, or
herded sheep in the fields, filled her with remorse. She thought of
the Egyptian pyramids and what bones lie beneath them as she stood
in the crypt; and the vast, empty hills which lie above the Sea of
Marmara seemed, for the moment, a finer dwelling-place than this
many-roomed mansion in which no bed lacked its quilt and no silver
dish its silver cover.</p>
<p>‘I am growing up,’ she thought, taking her taper. ‘I am losing
my illusions, perhaps to acquire new ones,’ and she paced down the
long gallery to her bedroom. It was a disagreeable process, and a
troublesome. But it was interesting, amazingly, she thought,
stretching her legs out to her log fire (for no sailor was
present), and she reviewed, as if it were an avenue of great
edifices, the progress of her own self along her own past.</p>
<p>How she had loved sound when she was a boy, and thought the
volley of tumultuous syllables from the lips the finest of all
poetry. Then — it was the effect of Sasha and her disillusionment
perhaps — into this high frenzy was let fall some black drop, which
turned her rhapsody into sluggishness. Slowly there had opened
within her something intricate and many-chambered, which one must
take a torch to explore, in prose not verse; and she remembered how
passionately she had studied that doctor at Norwich, Browne, whose
book was at her hand there. She had formed here in solitude after
her affair with Greene, or tried to form, for Heaven knows these
growths are agelong in coming, a spirit capable of resistance. ‘I
will write,’ she had said, ‘what I enjoy writing’; and so had
scratched out twenty-six volumes. Yet still, for all her travels
and adventures and profound thinkings and turnings this way and
that, she was only in process of fabrication. What the future might
bring, Heaven only knew. Change was incessant, and change perhaps
would never cease. High battlements of thought, habits that had
seemed durable as stone, went down like shadows at the touch of
another mind and left a naked sky and fresh stars twinkling in it.
Here she went to the window, and in spite of the cold could not
help unlatching it. She leant out into the damp night air. She
heard a fox bark in the woods, and the clutter of a pheasant
trailing through the branches. She heard the snow slither and flop
from the roof to the ground. ‘By my life,’ she exclaimed, ‘this is
a thousand times better than Turkey. Rustum,’ she cried, as if she
were arguing with the gipsy (and in this new power of bearing an
argument in mind and continuing it with someone who was not there
to contradict she showed again the development of her soul), ‘you
were wrong. This is better than Turkey. Hair, pastry, tobacco — of
what odds and ends are we compounded,’ she said (thinking of Queen
Mary’s prayer-book). ‘What a phantasmagoria the mind is and
meeting-place of dissemblables! At one moment we deplore our birth
and state and aspire to an ascetic exaltation; the next we are
overcome by the smell of some old garden path and weep to hear the
thrushes sing.’ And so bewildered as usual by the multitude of
things which call for explanation and imprint their message without
leaving any hint as to their meaning, she threw her cheroot out of
the window and went to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning, in pursuance of these thoughts, she had out her
pen and paper. and started afresh upon ‘The Oak Tree’, for to have
ink and paper in plenty when one has made do with berries and
margins is a delight not to be conceived. Thus she was now striking
out a phrase in the depths of despair, now in the heights of
ecstasy writing one in, when a shadow darkened the page. She
hastily hid her manuscript.</p>
<p>As her window gave on to the most central of the courts, as she
had given orders that she would see no one, as she knew no one and
was herself legally unknown, she was first surprised at the shadow,
then indignant at it, then (when she looked up and saw what caused
it) overcome with merriment. For it was a familiar shadow, a
grotesque shadow, the shadow of no less a personage than the
Archduchess Harriet Griselda of Finster-Aarhorn and Scand-op-Boom
in the Roumanian territory. She was loping across the court in her
old black riding-habit and mantle as before. Not a hair of her head
was changed. This then was the woman who had chased her from
England! This was the eyrie of that obscene vulture — this the
fatal fowl herself! At the thought that she had fled all the way to
Turkey to avoid her seductions (now become excessively flat),
Orlando laughed aloud. There was something inexpressibly comic in
the sight. She resembled, as Orlando had thought before, nothing so
much as a monstrous hare. She had the staring eyes, the lank
cheeks, the high headdress of that animal. She stopped now, much as
a hare sits erect in the corn when thinking itself unobserved, and
stared at Orlando, who stared back at her from the window. After
they had stared like this for a certain time, there was nothing for
it but to ask her in, and soon the two ladies were exchanging
compliments while the Archduchess struck the snow from her
mantle.</p>
<p>‘A plague on women,’ said Orlando to herself, going to the
cupboard to fetch a glass of wine, ‘they never leave one a moment’s
peace. A more ferreting, inquisiting, busybodying set of people
don’t exist. It was to escape this Maypole that I left England, and
now’— here she turned to present the Archduchess with the salver,
and behold — in her place stood a tall gentleman in black. A heap
of clothes lay in the fender. She was alone with a man.</p>
<p>Recalled thus suddenly to a consciousness of her sex, which she
had completely forgotten, and of his, which was now remote enough
to be equally upsetting, Orlando felt seized with faintness.</p>
<p>‘La!’ she cried, putting her hand to her side, ‘how you frighten
me!’</p>
<p>‘Gentle creature,’ cried the Archduchess, falling on one knee
and at the same time pressing a cordial to Orlando’s lips, ‘forgive
me for the deceit I have practised on you!’</p>
<p>Orlando sipped the wine and the Archduke knelt and kissed her
hand.</p>
<p>In short, they acted the parts of man and woman for ten minutes
with great vigour and then fell into natural discourse. The
Archduchess (but she must in future be known as the Archduke) told
his story — that he was a man and always had been one; that he had
seen a portrait of Orlando and fallen hopelessly in love with him;
that to compass his ends, he had dressed as a woman and lodged at
the Baker’s shop; that he was desolated when he fled to Turkey;
that he had heard of her change and hastened to offer his services
(here he teed and heed intolerably). For to him, said the Archduke
Harry, she was and would ever be the Pink, the Pearl, the
Perfection of her sex. The three p’s would have been more
persuasive if they had not been interspersed with tee-hees and
haw-haws of the strangest kind. ‘If this is love,’ said Orlando to
herself, looking at the Archduke on the other side of the fender,
and now from the woman’s point of view, ‘there is something highly
ridiculous about it.’</p>
<p>Falling on his knees, the Archduke Harry made the most
passionate declaration of his suit. He told her that he had
something like twenty million ducats in a strong box at his castle.
He had more acres than any nobleman in England. The shooting was
excellent: he could promise her a mixed bag of ptarmigan and grouse
such as no English moor, or Scotch either, could rival. True, the
pheasants had suffered from the gape in his absence, and the does
had slipped their young, but that could be put right, and would be
with her help when they lived in Roumania together.</p>
<p>As he spoke, enormous tears formed in his rather prominent eyes
and ran down the sandy tracts of his long and lanky cheeks.</p>
<p>That men cry as frequently and as unreasonably as women, Orlando
knew from her own experience as a man; but she was beginning to be
aware that women should be shocked when men display emotion in
their presence, and so, shocked she was.</p>
<p>The Archduke apologized. He commanded himself sufficiently to
say that he would leave her now, but would return on the following
day for his answer.</p>
<p>That was a Tuesday. He came on Wednesday; he came on Thursday;
he came on Friday; and he came on Saturday. It is true that each
visit began, continued, or concluded with a declaration of love,
but in between there was much room for silence. They sat on either
side of the fireplace and sometimes the Archduke knocked over the
fire-irons and Orlando picked them up again. Then the Archduke
would bethink him how he had shot an elk in Sweden, and Orlando
would ask, was it a very big elk, and the Archduke would say that
it was not as big as the reindeer which he shot in Norway; and
Orlando would ask, had he ever shot a tiger, and the Archduke would
say he had shot an albatross, and Orlando would say (half hiding
her yawn) was an albatross as big as an elephant, and the Archduke
would say — something very sensible, no doubt, but Orlando heard it
not, for she was looking at her writing-table, out of the window,
at the door. Upon which the Archduke would say, ‘I adore you’, at
the very same moment that Orlando said ‘Look, it’s beginning to
rain’, at which they were both much embarrassed, and blushed
scarlet, and could neither of them think what to say next. Indeed,
Orlando was at her wit’s end what to talk about and had she not
bethought her of a game called Fly Loo, at which great sums of
money can be lost with very little expense of spirit, she would
have had to marry him, she supposed; for how else to get rid of him
she knew not. By this device, however, and it was a simple one,
needing only three lumps of sugar and a sufficiency of flies, the
embarrassment of conversation was overcome and the necessity of
marriage avoided. For now, the Archduke would bet her five hundred
pounds to a tester that a fly would settle on this lump and not on
that. Thus, they would have occupation for a whole morning watching
the flies (who were naturally sluggish at this season and often
spent an hour or so circling round the ceiling) until at length
some fine bluebottle made his choice and the match was won. Many
hundreds of pounds changed hands between them at this game, which
the Archduke, who was a born gambler, swore was every bit as good
as horse racing, and vowed he could play at for ever. But Orlando
soon began to weary.</p>
<p>What’s the good of being a fine young woman in the prime of
life’, she asked, ‘if I have to pass all my mornings watching
blue-bottles with an Archduke?’</p>
<p>She began to detest the sight of sugar; flies made her dizzy.
Some way out of the difficulty there must be, she supposed, but she
was still awkward in the arts of her sex, and as she could no
longer knock a man over the head or run him through the body with a
rapier, she could think of no better method than this. She caught a
blue-bottle, gently pressed the life out of it (it was half dead
already; or her kindness for the dumb creatures would not have
permitted it) and secured it by a drop of gum arabic to a lump of
sugar. While the Archduke was gazing at the ceiling, she deftly
substituted this lump for the one she had laid her money on, and
crying ‘Loo Loo!’ declared that she had won her bet. Her reckoning
was that the Archduke, with all his knowledge of sport and
horseracing, would detect the fraud and, as to cheat at Loo is the
most heinous of crimes, and men have been banished from the society
of mankind to that of apes in the tropics for ever because of it,
she calculated that he would be manly enough to refuse to have
anything further to do with her. But she misjudged the simplicity
of the amiable nobleman. He was no nice judge of flies. A dead fly
looked to him much the same as a living one. She played the trick
twenty times on him and he paid her over 17,250 pounds (which is
about 40,885 pounds 6 shillings and 8 pence of our own money)
before Orlando cheated so grossly that even he could be deceived no
longer. When he realized the truth at last, a painful scene ensued.
The Archduke rose to his full height. He coloured scarlet. Tears
rolled down his cheeks one by one. That she had won a fortune from
him was nothing — she was welcome to it; that she had deceived him
was something — it hurt him to think her capable of it; but that
she had cheated at Loo was everything. To love a woman who cheated
at play was, he said, impossible. Here he broke down completely.
Happily, he said, recovering slightly, there were no witnesses. She
was, after all, only a woman, he said. In short, he was preparing
in the chivalry of his heart to forgive her and had bent to ask her
pardon for the violence of his language, when she cut the matter
short, as he stooped his proud head, by dropping a small toad
between his skin and his shirt.</p>
<p>In justice to her, it must be said that she would infinitely
have preferred a rapier. Toads are clammy things to conceal about
one’s person a whole morning. But if rapiers are forbidden; one
must have recourse to toads. Moreover toads and laughter between
them sometimes do what cold steel cannot. She laughed. The Archduke
blushed. She laughed. The Archduke cursed. She laughed. The
Archduke slammed the door.</p>
<p>‘Heaven be praised!’ cried Orlando still laughing. She heard the
sound of chariot wheels driven at a furious pace down the
courtyard. She heard them rattle along the road. Fainter and
fainter the sound became. Now it faded away altogether.</p>
<p>‘I am alone,’ said Orlando, aloud since there was no one to
hear.</p>
<p>That silence is more profound after noise still wants the
confirmation of science. But that loneliness is more apparent
directly after one has been made love to, many women would take
their oath. As the sound of the Archduke’s chariot wheels died
away, Orlando felt drawing further from her and further from her an
Archduke (she did not mind that), a fortune (she did not mind
that), a title (she did not mind that), the safety and circumstance
of married life (she did not mind that), but life she heard going
from her, and a lover. ‘Life and a lover,’ she murmured; and going
to her writing-table she dipped her pen in the ink and wrote:</p>
<p>‘Life and a lover’— a line which did not scan and made no sense
with what went before — something about the proper way of dipping
sheep to avoid the scab. Reading it over she blushed and
repeated,</p>
<p>‘Life and a lover.’ Then laying her pen aside she went into her
bedroom, stood in front of her mirror, and arranged her pearls
about her neck. Then since pearls do not show to advantage against
a morning gown of sprigged cotton, she changed to a dove grey
taffeta; thence to one of peach bloom; thence to a wine-coloured
brocade. Perhaps a dash of powder was needed, and if her hair were
disposed — so — about her brow, it might become her. Then she
slipped her feet into pointed slippers, and drew an emerald ring
upon her finger. ‘Now,’ she said when all was ready and lit the
silver sconces on either side of the mirror. What woman would not
have kindled to see what Orlando saw then burning in the snow — for
all about the looking-glass were snowy lawns, and she was like a
fire, a burning bush, and the candle flames about her head were
silver leaves; or again, the glass was green water, and she a
mermaid, slung with pearls, a siren in a cave, singing so that
oarsmen leant from their boats and fell down, down to embrace her;
so dark, so bright, so hard, so soft, was she, so astonishingly
seductive that it was a thousand pities that there was no one there
to put it in plain English, and say outright, ‘Damn it, Madam, you
are loveliness incarnate,’ which was the truth. Even Orlando (who
had no conceit of her person) knew it, for she smiled the
involuntary smile which women smile when their own beauty, which
seems not their own, forms like a drop falling or a fountain rising
and confronts them all of a sudden in the glass — this smile she
smiled and then she listened for a moment and heard only the leaves
blowing and the sparrows twittering, and then she sighed, ‘Life, a
lover,’ and then she turned on her heel with extraordinary
rapidity; whipped her pearls from her neck, stripped the satins
from her back, stood erect in the neat black silk knickerbockers of
an ordinary nobleman, and rang the bell. When the servant came, she
told him to order a coach and six to be in readiness instantly. She
was summoned by urgent affairs to London. Within an hour of the
Archduke’s departure, off she drove.</p>
<p>And as she drove, we may seize the opportunity, since the
landscape was of a simple English kind which needs no description,
to draw the reader’s attention more particularly than we could at
the moment to one or two remarks which have slipped in here and
there in the course of the narrative. For example, it may have been
observed that Orlando hid her manuscripts when interrupted. Next,
that she looked long and intently in the glass; and now, as she
drove to London, one might notice her starting and suppressing a
cry when the horses galloped faster than she liked. Her modesty as
to her writing, her vanity as to her person, her fears for her
safety all seems to hint that what was said a short time ago about
there being no change in Orlando the man and Orlando the woman, was
ceasing to be altogether true. She was becoming a little more
modest, as women are, of her brains, and a little more vain, as
women are, of her person. Certain susceptibilities were asserting
themselves, and others were diminishing. The change of clothes had,
some philosophers will say, much to do with it. Vain trifles as
they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than
merely to keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the
world’s view of us. For example, when Captain Bartolus saw
Orlando’s skirt, he had an awning stretched for her immediately,
pressed her to take another slice of beef, and invited her to go
ashore with him in the long-boat. These compliments would certainly
not have been paid her had her skirts, instead of flowing, been cut
tight to her legs in the fashion of breeches. And when we are paid
compliments, it behoves us to make some return. Orlando curtseyed;
she complied; she flattered the good man’s humours as she would not
have done had his neat breeches been a woman’s skirts, and his
braided coat a woman’s satin bodice. Thus, there is much to support
the view that it is clothes that wear us and not we them; we may
make them take the mould of arm or breast, but they mould our
hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking. So, having now
worn skirts for a considerable time, a certain change was visible
in Orlando, which is to be found if the reader will look at @
above, even in her face. If we compare the picture of Orlando as a
man with that of Orlando as a woman we shall see that though both
are undoubtedly one and the same person, there are certain changes.
The man has his hand free to seize his sword, the woman must use
hers to keep the satins from slipping from her shoulders. The man
looks the world full in the face, as if it were made for his uses
and fashioned to his liking. The woman takes a sidelong glance at
it, full of subtlety, even of suspicion. Had they both worn the
same clothes, it is possible that their outlook might have been the
same.</p>
<p>That is the view of some philosophers and wise ones, but on the
whole, we incline to another. The difference between the sexes is,
happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of
something hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that
dictated her choice of a woman’s dress and of a woman’s sex. And
perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than
usual — openness indeed was the soul of her nature — something that
happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed. For
here again, we come to a dilemma. Different though the sexes are,
they intermix. In every human being a vacillation from one sex to
the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep
the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very
opposite of what it is above. Of the complications and confusions
which thus result everyone has had experience; but here we leave
the general question and note only the odd effect it had in the
particular case of Orlando herself.</p>
<p>For it was this mixture in her of man and woman, one being
uppermost and then the other, that often gave her conduct an
unexpected turn. The curious of her own sex would argue, for
example, if Orlando was a woman, how did she never take more than
ten minutes to dress? And were not her clothes chosen rather at
random, and sometimes worn rather shabby? And then they would say,
still, she has none of the formality of a man, or a man’s love of
power. She is excessively tender-hearted. She could not endure to
see a donkey beaten or a kitten drowned. Yet again, they noted, she
detested household matters, was up at dawn and out among the fields
in summer before the sun had risen. No farmer knew more about the
crops than she did. She could drink with the best and liked games
of hazard. She rode well and drove six horses at a gallop over
London Bridge. Yet again, though bold and active as a man, it was
remarked that the sight of another in danger brought on the most
womanly palpitations. She would burst into tears on slight
provocation. She was unversed in geography, found mathematics
intolerable, and held some caprices which are more common among
women than men, as for instance that to travel south is to travel
downhill. Whether, then, Orlando was most man or woman, it is
difficult to say and cannot now be decided. For her coach was now
rattling on the cobbles. She had reached her home in the city. The
steps were being let down; the iron gates were being opened. She
was entering her father’s house at Blackfriars, which though
fashion was fast deserting that end of the town, was still a
pleasant, roomy mansion, with gardens running down to the river,
and a pleasant grove of nut trees to walk in.</p>
<p>Here she took up her lodging and began instantly to look about
her for what she had come in search of — that is to say, life and a
lover. About the first there might be some doubt; the second she
found without the least difficulty two days after her arrival. It
was a Tuesday that she came to town. On Thursday she went for a
walk in the Mall, as was then the habit of persons of quality. She
had not made more than a turn or two of the avenue before she was
observed by a little knot of vulgar people who go there to spy upon
their betters. As she came past them, a common woman carrying a
child at her breast stepped forward, peered familiarly into
Orlando’s face, and cried out, ‘Lawk upon us, if it ain’t the Lady
Orlando!’ Her companions came crowding round, and Orlando found
herself in a moment the centre of a mob of staring citizens and
tradesmen’s wives, all eager to gaze upon the heroine of the
celebrated lawsuit. Such was the interest that the case excited in
the minds of the common people. She might, indeed, have found
herself gravely discommoded by the pressure of the crowd — she had
forgotten that ladies are not supposed to walk in public places
alone — had not a tall gentleman at once stepped forward and
offered her the protection of his arm. It was the Archduke. She was
overcome with distress and yet with some amusement at the sight.
Not only had this magnanimous nobleman forgiven her, but in order
to show that he took her levity with the toad in good part, he had
procured a jewel made in the shape of that reptile which he pressed
upon her with a repetition of his suit as he handed her to her
coach.</p>
<p>What with the crowd, what with the Duke, what with the jewel,
she drove home in the vilest temper imaginable. Was it impossible
then to go for a walk without being half-suffocated, presented with
a toad set in emeralds, and asked in marriage by an Archduke? She
took a kinder view of the case next day when she found on her
breakfast table half a dozen billets from some of the greatest
ladies in the land — Lady Suffolk, Lady Salisbury, Lady
Chesterfield, Lady Tavistock, and others who reminded her in the
politest manner of old alliances between their families and her
own, and desired the honour of her acquaintance. Next day, which
was a Saturday, many of these great ladies waited on her in person.
On Tuesday, about noon, their footmen brought cards of invitation
to various routs, dinners, and assemblies in the near future; so
that Orlando was launched without delay, and with some splash and
foam at that, upon the waters of London society.</p>
<p>To give a truthful account of London society at that or indeed
at any other time, is beyond the powers of the biographer or the
historian. Only those who have little need of the truth, and no
respect for it — the poets and the novelists — can be trusted to do
it, for this is one of the cases where the truth does not exist.
Nothing exists. The whole thing is a miasma — a mirage. To make our
meaning plain — Orlando could come home from one of these routs at
three or four in the morning with cheeks like a Christmas tree and
eyes like stars. She would untie a lace, pace the room a score of
times, untie another lace, stop, and pace the room again. Often the
sun would be blazing over Southwark chimneys before she could
persuade herself to get into bed, and there she would lie, pitching
and tossing, laughing and sighing for an hour or longer before she
slept at last. And what was all this stir about? Society. And what
had society said or done to throw a reasonable lady into such an
excitement? In plain language, nothing. Rack her memory as she
would, next day Orlando could never remember a single word to
magnify into the name something. Lord O. had been gallant. Lord A.
polite. The Marquis of C. charming. Mr M. amusing. But when she
tried to recollect in what their gallantry, politeness, charm, or
wit had consisted, she was bound to suppose her memory at fault,
for she could not name a thing. It was the same always. Nothing
remained over the next day, yet the excitement of the moment was
intense. Thus we are forced to conclude that society is one of
those brews such as skilled housekeepers serve hot about Christmas
time, whose flavour depends upon the proper mixing and stirring of
a dozen different ingredients. Take one out, and it is in itself
insipid. Take away Lord O., Lord A., Lord C., or Mr M. and
separately each is nothing. Stir them all together and they combine
to give off the most intoxicating of flavours, the most seductive
of scents. Yet this intoxication, this seductiveness, entirely
evade our analysis. At one and the same time, therefore, society is
everything and society is nothing. Society is the most powerful
concoction in the world and society has no existence whatsoever.
Such monsters the poets and the novelists alone can deal with; with
such something-nothings their works are stuffed out to prodigious
size; and to them with the best will in the world we are content to
leave it.</p>
<p>Following the example of our predecessors, therefore, we will
only say that society in the reign of Queen Anne was of
unparalleled brilliance. To have the entry there was the aim of
every well-bred person. The graces were supreme. Fathers instructed
their sons, mothers their daughters. No education was complete for
either sex which did not include the science of deportment, the art
of bowing and curtseying, the management of the sword and the fan,
the care of the teeth, the conduct of the leg, the flexibility of
the knee, the proper methods of entering and leaving the room, with
a thousand etceteras, such as will immediately suggest themselves
to anybody who has himself been in society. Since Orlando had won
the praise of Queen Elizabeth for the way she handed a bowl of rose
water as a boy, it must be supposed that she was sufficiently
expert to pass muster. Yet it is true that there was an
absentmindedness about her which sometimes made her clumsy; she was
apt to think of poetry when she should have been thinking of
taffeta; her walk was a little too much of a stride for a woman,
perhaps, and her gestures, being abrupt, might endanger a cup of
tea on occasion.</p>
<p>Whether this slight disability was enough to counterbalance the
splendour of her bearing, or whether she inherited a drop too much
of that black humour which ran in the veins of all her race,
certain it is that she had not been in the world more than a score
of times before she might have been heard to ask herself, had there
been anybody but her spaniel Pippin to hear her, ‘What the devil is
the matter with me?’ The occasion was Tuesday, the 16th of June
1712; she had just returned from a great ball at Arlington House;
the dawn was in the sky, and she was pulling off her stockings. ‘I
don’t care if I never meet another soul as long as I live,’ cried
Orlando, bursting into tears. Lovers she had in plenty, but life,
which is, after all, of some importance in its way, escaped her.
‘Is this’, she asked — but there was none to answer, ‘is this’, she
finished her sentence all the same, ‘what people call life?’ The
spaniel raised her forepaw in token of sympathy. The spaniel licked
Orlando with her tongue. Orlando stroked the spaniel with her hand.
Orlando kissed the spaniel with her lips. In short, there was the
truest sympathy between them that can be between a dog and its
mistress, and yet it cannot be denied that the dumbness of animals
is a great impediment to the refinements of intercourse. They wag
their tails; they bow the front part of the body and elevate the
hind; they roll, they jump, they paw, they whine, they bark, they
slobber, they have all sorts of ceremonies and artifices of their
own, but the whole thing is of no avail, since speak they cannot.
Such was her quarrel, she thought, setting the dog gently on to the
floor, with the great people at Arlington House. They, too, wag
their tails, bow, roll, jump, paw, and slobber, but talk they
cannot. ‘All these months that I’ve been out in the world’, said
Orlando, pitching one stocking across the room, ‘I’ve heard nothing
but what Pippin might have said. I’m cold. I’m happy. I’m hungry.
I’ve caught a mouse. I’ve buried a bone. Please kiss my nose.’ And
it was not enough.</p>
<p>How, in so short a time, she had passed from intoxication to
disgust we will only seek to explain by supposing that this
mysterious composition which we call society, is nothing absolutely
good or bad in itself, but has a spirit in it, volatile but potent,
which either makes you drunk when you think it, as Orlando thought
it, delightful, or gives you a headache when you think it, as
Orlando thought it, repulsive. That the faculty of speech has much
to do with it either way, we take leave to doubt. Often a dumb hour
is the most ravishing of all; brilliant wit can be tedious beyond
description. But to the poets we leave it, and so on with our
story.</p>
<p>Orlando threw the second stocking after the first and went to
bed dismally enough, determined that she would forswear society for
ever. But again as it turned out, she was too hasty in coming to
her conclusions. For the very next morning she woke to find, among
the usual cards of invitation upon her table, one from a certain
great Lady, the Countess of R. Having determined overnight that she
would never go into society again, we can only explain Orlando’s
behaviour — she sent a messenger hot-foot to R— House to say that
she would attend her Ladyship with all the pleasure in the world —
by the fact that she was still suffering from the effect of three
honeyed words dropped into her ear on the deck of the “Enamoured
Lady” by Captain Nicholas Benedict Bartolus as they sailed down the
Thames. Addison, Dryden, Pope, he had said, pointing to the Cocoa
Tree, and Addison, Dryden, Pope had chimed in her head like an
incantation ever since. Who can credit such folly? but so it was.
All her experience with Nick Greene had taught her nothing. Such
names still exercised over her the most powerful fascination.
Something, perhaps, we must believe in, and as Orlando, we have
said, had no belief in the usual divinities she bestowed her
credulity upon great men — yet with a distinction. Admirals,
soldiers, statesmen, moved her not at all. But the very thought of
a great writer stirred her to such a pitch of belief that she
almost believed him to be invisible. Her instinct was a sound one.
One can only believe entirely, perhaps, in what one cannot see. The
little glimpse she had of these great men from the deck of the ship
was of the nature of a vision. That the cup was china, or the
gazette paper, she doubted. When Lord O. said one day that he had
dined with Dryden the night before, she flatly disbelieved him.
Now, the Lady R.’s reception room had the reputation of being the
antechamber to the presence room of genius; it was the place where
men and women met to swing censers and chant hymns to the bust of
genius in a niche in the wall. Sometimes the God himself vouchsafed
his presence for a moment. Intellect alone admitted the suppliant,
and nothing (so the report ran) was said inside that was not
witty.</p>
<p>It was thus with great trepidation that Orlando entered the
room. She found a company already assembled in a semicircle round
the fire. Lady R., an oldish lady, of dark complexion, with a black
lace mantilla on her head, was seated in a great arm-chair in the
centre. Thus being somewhat deaf, she could control the
conversation on both sides of her. On both sides of her sat men and
women of the highest distinction. Every man, it was said, had been
a Prime Minister and every woman, it was whispered, had been the
mistress of a king. Certain it is that all were brilliant, and all
were famous. Orlando took her seat with a deep reverence in
silence… After three hours, she curtseyed profoundly and left.</p>
<p>But what, the reader may ask with some exasperation, happened in
between. In three hours, such a company must have said the
wittiest, the profoundest, the most interesting things in the
world. So it would seem indeed. But the fact appears to be that
they said nothing. It is a curious characteristic which they share
with all the most brilliant societies that the world has seen. Old
Madame du Deffand and her friends talked for fifty years without
stopping. And of it all, what remains? Perhaps three witty sayings.
So that we are at liberty to suppose either that nothing was said,
or that nothing witty was said, or that the fraction of three witty
sayings lasted eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty nights,
which does not leave a liberal allowance of wit for any one of
them.</p>
<p>The truth would seem to be — if we dare use such a word in such
a connection — that all these groups of people lie under an
enchantment. The hostess is our modern Sibyl. She is a witch who
lays her guests under a spell. In this house they think themselves
happy; in that witty; in a third profound. It is all an illusion
(which is nothing against it, for illusions are the most valuable
and necessary of all things, and she who can create one is among
the world’s greatest benefactors), but as it is notorious that
illusions are shattered by conflict with reality, so no real
happiness, no real wit, no real profundity are tolerated where the
illusion prevails. This serves to explain why Madame du Deffand
said no more than three witty things in the course of fifty years.
Had she said more, her circle would have been destroyed. The
witticism, as it left her lips, bowled over the current
conversation as a cannon ball lays low the violets and the daisies.
When she made her famous ‘mot de Saint Denis’ the very grass was
singed. Disillusionment and desolation followed. Not a word was
uttered. ‘Spare us another such, for Heaven’s sake, Madame!’ her
friends cried with one accord. And she obeyed. For almost seventeen
years she said nothing memorable and all went well. The beautiful
counterpane of illusion lay unbroken on her circle as it lay
unbroken on the circle of Lady R. The guests thought that they were
happy, thought that they were witty, thought that they were
profound, and, as they thought this, other people thought it still
more strongly; and so it got about that nothing was more delightful
than one of Lady R.’s assemblies; everyone envied those who were
admitted; those who were admitted envied themselves because other
people envied them; and so there seemed no end to it — except that
which we have now to relate.</p>
<p>For about the third time Orlando went there a certain incident
occurred. She was still under the illusion that she was listening
to the most brilliant epigrams in the world, though, as a matter of
fact, old General C. was only saying, at some length, how the gout
had left his left leg and gone to his right, while Mr L.
interrupted when any proper name was mentioned, ‘R.? Oh! I know
Billy R. as well as I know myself. S.? My dearest friend. T.?
Stayed with him a fortnight in Yorkshire’— which, such is the force
of illusion, sounded like the wittiest repartee, the most searching
comment upon human life, and kept the company in a roar; when the
door opened and a little gentleman entered whose name Orlando did
not catch. Soon a curiously disagreeable sensation came over her.
To judge from their faces, the rest began to feel it as well. One
gentleman said there was a draught. The Marchioness of C. feared a
cat must be under the sofa. It was as if their eyes were being
slowly opened after a pleasant dream and nothing met them but a
cheap wash-stand and a dirty counterpane. It was as if the fumes of
some delicious wine were slowly leaving them. Still the General
talked and still Mr L. remembered. But it became more and more
apparent how red the General’s neck was, how bald Mr L.’s head was.
As for what they said — nothing more tedious and trivial could be
imagined. Everybody fidgeted and those who had fans yawned behind
them. At last Lady R. rapped with hers upon the arm of her great
chair. Both gentlemen stopped talking.</p>
<p>Then the little gentleman said, He said next, He said finally
(These sayings are too well known to require repetition, and
besides, they are all to be found in his published works.),</p>
<p>Here, it cannot be denied, was true wit, true wisdom, true
profundity. The company was thrown into complete dismay. One such
saying was bad enough; but three, one after another, on the same
evening! No society could survive it.</p>
<p>‘Mr Pope,’ said old Lady R. in a voice trembling with sarcastic
fury, ‘you are pleased to be witty.’ Mr Pope flushed red. Nobody
spoke a word. They sat in dead silence some twenty minutes. Then,
one by one, they rose and slunk from the room. That they would ever
come back after such an experience was doubtful. Link-boys could be
heard calling their coaches all down South Audley Street. Doors
were slammed and carriages drove off. Orlando found herself near Mr
Pope on the staircase. His lean and misshapen frame was shaken by a
variety of emotions. Darts of malice, rage, triumph, wit, and
terror (he was shaking like a leaf) shot from his eyes. He looked
like some squat reptile set with a burning topaz in its forehead.
At the same time, the strangest tempest of emotion seized now upon
the luckless Orlando. A disillusionment so complete as that
inflicted not an hour ago leaves the mind rocking from side to
side. Everything appears ten times more bare and stark than before.
It is a moment fraught with the highest danger for the human
spirit. Women turn nuns and men priests in such moments. In such
moments, rich men sign away their wealth; and happy men cut their
throats with carving knives. Orlando would have done all willingly,
but there was a rasher thing still for her to do, and this she did.
She invited Mr Pope to come home with her.</p>
<p>For if it is rash to walk into a lion’s den unarmed, rash to
navigate the Atlantic in a rowing boat, rash to stand on one foot
on the top of St Paul’s, it is still more rash to go home alone
with a poet. A poet is Atlantic and lion in one. While one drowns
us the other gnaws us. If we survive the teeth, we succumb to the
waves. A man who can destroy illusions is both beast and flood.
Illusions are to the soul what atmosphere is to the earth. Roll up
that tender air and the plant dies, the colour fades. The earth we
walk on is a parched cinder. It is marl we tread and fiery cobbles
scorch our feet. By the truth we are undone. Life is a dream. ‘Tis
waking that kills us. He who robs us of our dreams robs us of our
life —(and so on for six pages if you will, but the style is
tedious and may well be dropped).</p>
<p>On this showing, however, Orlando should have been a heap of
cinders by the time the chariot drew up at her house in
Blackfriars. That she was still flesh and blood, though certainly
exhausted, is entirely due to a fact to which we drew attention
earlier in the narrative. The less we see the more we believe. Now
the streets that lie between Mayfair and Blackfriars were at that
time very imperfectly lit. True, the lighting was a great
improvement upon that of the Elizabethan age. Then the benighted
traveller had to trust to the stars or the red flame of some night
watchman to save him from the gravel pits at Park Lane or the oak
woods where swine rootled in the Tottenham Court Road. But even so
it wanted much of our modern efficiency. Lamp-posts lit with
oil-lamps occurred every two hundred yards or so, but between lay a
considerable stretch of pitch darkness. Thus for ten minutes
Orlando and Mr Pope would be in blackness; and then for about half
a minute again in the light. A very strange state of mind was thus
bred in Orlando. As the light faded, she began to feel steal over
her the most delicious balm. ‘This is indeed a very great honour
for a young woman to be driving with Mr Pope,’ she began to think,
looking at the outline of his nose. ‘I am the most blessed of my
sex. Half an inch from me — indeed, I feel the knot of his knee
ribbons pressing against my thigh — is the greatest wit in Her
Majesty’s dominions. Future ages will think of us with curiosity
and envy me with fury.’ Here came the lamp-post again. ‘What a
foolish wretch I am!’ she thought. ‘There is no such thing as fame
and glory. Ages to come will never cast a thought on me or on Mr
Pope either. What’s an “age”, indeed? What are “we”?’ and their
progress through Berkeley Square seemed the groping of two blind
ants, momentarily thrown together without interest or concern in
common, across a blackened desert. She shivered. But here again was
darkness. Her illusion revived. ‘How noble his brow is,’ she
thought (mistaking a hump on a cushion for Mr Pope’s forehead in
the darkness). ‘What a weight of genius lives in it! What wit,
wisdom, and truth — what a wealth of all those jewels, indeed, for
which people are ready to barter their lives! Yours is the only
light that burns for ever. But for you the human pilgrimage would
be performed in utter darkness’; (here the coach gave a great lurch
as it fell into a rut in Park Lane) ‘without genius we should be
upset and undone. Most august, most lucid of beams,’— thus she was
apostrophizing the hump on the cushion when they drove beneath one
of the street lamps in Berkeley Square and she realized her
mistake. Mr Pope had a forehead no bigger than another man’s.
‘Wretched man,’ she thought, ‘how you have deceived me! I took that
hump for your forehead. When one sees you plain, how ignoble, how
despicable you are! Deformed and weakly, there is nothing to
venerate in you, much to pity, most to despise.’</p>
<p>Again they were in darkness and her anger became modified
directly she could see nothing but the poet’s knees.</p>
<p>‘But it is I that am a wretch,’ she reflected, once they were in
complete obscurity again, ‘for base as you may be, am I not still
baser? It is you who nourish and protect me, you who scare the wild
beast, frighten the savage, make me clothes of the silkworm’s wool,
and carpets of the sheep’s. If I want to worship, have you not
provided me with an image of yourself and set it in the sky? Are
not evidences of your care everywhere? How humble, how grateful,
how docile, should I not be, therefore? Let it be all my joy to
serve, honour, and obey you.’</p>
<p>Here they reached the big lamp-post at the corner of what is now
Piccadilly Circus. The light blazed in her eyes, and she saw,
besides some degraded creatures of her own sex, two wretched
pigmies on a stark desert land. Both were naked, solitary, and
defenceless. The one was powerless to help the other. Each had
enough to do to look after itself. Looking Mr Pope full in the
face, ‘It is equally vain’, she thought; ‘for you to think you can
protect me, or for me to think I can worship you. The light of
truth beats upon us without shadow, and the light of truth is
damnably unbecoming to us both.’</p>
<p>All this time, of course, they went on talking agreeably, as
people of birth and education use, about the Queen’s temper and the
Prime Minister’s gout, while the coach went from light to darkness
down the Haymarket, along the Strand, up Fleet Street, and reached,
at length, her house in Blackfriars. For some time the dark spaces
between the lamps had been becoming brighter and the lamps
themselves less bright — that is to say, the sun was rising, and it
was in the equable but confused light of a summer’s morning in
which everything is seen but nothing is seen distinctly that they
alighted, Mr Pope handing Orlando from her carriage and Orlando
curtseying Mr Pope to precede her into her mansion with the most
scrupulous attention to the rites of the Graces.</p>
<p>From the foregoing passage, however, it must not be supposed
that genius (but the disease is now stamped out in the British
Isles, the late Lord Tennyson, it is said, being the last person to
suffer from it) is constantly alight, for then we should see
everything plain and perhaps should be scorched to death in the
process. Rather it resembles the lighthouse in its working, which
sends one ray and then no more for a time; save that genius is much
more capricious in its manifestations and may flash six or seven
beams in quick succession (as Mr Pope did that night) and then
lapse into darkness for a year or for ever. To steer by its beams
is therefore impossible, and when the dark spell is on them men of
genius are, it is said, much like other people.</p>
<p>It was happy for Orlando, though at first disappointing, that
this should be so, for she now began to live much in the company of
men of genius. Nor were they so different from the rest of us as
one might have supposed. Addison, Pope, Swift, proved, she found,
to be fond of tea. They liked arbours. They collected little bits
of coloured glass. They adored grottos. Rank was not distasteful to
them. Praise was delightful. They wore plum-coloured suits one day
and grey another. Mr Swift had a fine malacca cane. Mr Addison
scented his handkerchiefs. Mr Pope suffered with his head. A piece
of gossip did not come amiss. Nor were they without their
jealousies. (We are jotting down a few reflections that came to
Orlando higgledy-piggledy.) At first, she was annoyed with herself
for noticing such trifles, and kept a book in which to write down
their memorable sayings, but the page remained empty. All the same,
her spirits revived, and she took to tearing up her cards of
invitation to great parties; kept her evenings free; began to look
forward to Mr Pope’s visit, to Mr Addison’s, to Mr Swift’s — and so
on and so on. If the reader will here refer to the “Rape of the
Lock”, to the “Spectator”, to “Gulliver’s Travels”, he will
understand precisely what these mysterious words may mean. Indeed,
biographers and critics might save themselves all their labours if
readers would only take this advice. For when we read:</p>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whether the Nymph shall break Diana’s Law,</p>
<p>Or some frail China Jar receive a Flaw,</p>
<p>Or stain her Honour, or her new Brocade,</p>
<p>Forget her Pray’rs or miss a Masquerade,</p>
<p>Or lose her Heart, or Necklace, at a Ball.</p>
</div>
<p>— we know as if we heard him how Mr Pope’s tongue flickered like
a lizard’s, how his eyes flashed, how his hand trembled, how he
loved, how he lied, how he suffered. In short, every secret of a
writer’s soul, every experience of his life; every quality of his
mind is written large in his works; yet we require critics to
explain the one and biographers to expound the other. That time
hangs heavy on people’s hands is the only explanation of the
monstrous growth.</p>
<p>So, now that we have read a page or two of the “Rape of the
Lock”, we know exactly why Orlando was so much amused and so much
frightened and so very bright-cheeked and bright-eyed that
afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs Nelly then knocked at the door to say that Mr Addison waited
on her Ladyship. At this, Mr Pope got up with a wry smile, made his
congee, and limped off. In came Mr Addison. Let us, as he takes his
seat, read the following passage from the “Spectator”:</p>
<p>‘I consider woman as a beautiful, romantic animal, that may be
adorned with furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and
silks. The lynx shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a
tippet, the peacock, parrot and swan shall pay contributions to her
muff; the sea shall be searched for shells, and the rocks for gems,
and every part of nature furnish out its share towards the
embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work of it.
All this, I shall indulge them in, but as for the petticoat I have
been speaking of, I neither can, nor will allow it.’</p>
<p>We hold that gentleman, cocked hat and all, in the hollow, of
our hands. Look once more into the crystal. Is he not clear to the
very wrinkle in his stocking? Does not every ripple and curve of
his wit lie exposed before us, and his benignity and his timidity
and his urbanity and the fact that he would marry a Countess and
die very respectably in the end? All is clear. And when Mr Addison
has said his say, there is a terrific rap at the door, and Mr
Swift, who had these arbitrary ways with him, walks in unannounced.
One moment, where is “Gulliver’s Travels”? Here it is! Let us read
a passage from the voyage to the Houyhnhnms:</p>
<p>‘I enjoyed perfect Health of Body and Tranquillity of Mind; I
did not find the Treachery or Inconstancy of a Friend, nor the
Injuries of a secret or open Enemy. I had no occasion of bribing,
flattering or pimping, to procure the Favour of any great Man or of
his Minion. I wanted no Fence against Fraud or Oppression; Here was
neither Physician to destroy my Body, nor Lawyer to ruin my
Fortune; No Informer to watch my Words, and Actions, or forge
Accusations against me for Hire: Here were no Gibers, Censurers,
Backbiters, Pickpockets, Highwaymen, Housebreakers, Attorneys,
Bawds, Buffoons, Gamesters, Politicians, Wits, splenetick tedious
Talkers… ’</p>
<p>But stop, stop your iron pelt of words, lest you flay us all
alive, and yourself too! Nothing can be plainer than that violent
man. He is so coarse and yet so clean; so brutal, yet so kind;
scorns the whole world, yet talks baby language to a girl, and will
die, can we doubt it? in a madhouse.</p>
<p>So Orlando poured out tea for them all; and sometimes, when the
weather was fine, she carried them down to the country with her,
and feasted them royally in the Round Parlour, which she had hung
with their pictures all in a circle, so that Mr Pope could not say
that Mr Addison came before him, or the other way about. They were
very witty, too (but their wit is all in their books) and taught
her the most important part of style, which is the natural run of
the voice in speaking — a quality which none that has not heard it
can imitate, not Greene even, with all his skill; for it is born of
the air, and breaks like a wave on the furniture, and rolls and
fades away, and is never to be recaptured, least of all by those
who prick up their ears, half a century later, and try. They taught
her this, merely by the cadence of their voices in speech; so that
her style changed somewhat, and she wrote some very pleasant, witty
verses and characters in prose. And so she lavished her wine on
them and put bank-notes, which they took very kindly, beneath their
plates at dinner, and accepted their dedications, and thought
herself highly honoured by the exchange.</p>
<p>Thus time ran on, and Orlando could often be heard saying to
herself with an emphasis which might, perhaps, make the hearer a
little suspicious, ‘Upon my soul, what a life this is!’ (For she
was still in search of that commodity.) But circumstances soon
forced her to consider the matter more narrowly.</p>
<p>One day she was pouring out tea for Mr Pope while, as anyone can
tell from the verses quoted above, he sat very bright-eyed,
observant, and all crumpled up in a chair by her side.</p>
<p>‘Lord,’ she thought, as she raised the sugar tongs, ‘how women
in ages to come will envy me! And yet —’ she paused; for Mr Pope
needed her attention. And yet — let us finish her thought for her —
when anybody says ‘How future ages will envy me’, it is safe to say
that they are extremely uneasy at the present moment. Was this life
quite so exciting, quite so flattering, quite so glorious as it
sounds when the memoir writer has done his work upon it? For one
thing, Orlando had a positive hatred of tea; for another, the
intellect, divine as it is, and all-worshipful, has a habit of
lodging in the most seedy of carcases, and often, alas, acts the
cannibal among the other faculties so that often, where the Mind is
biggest, the Heart, the Senses, Magnanimity, Charity, Tolerance,
Kindliness, and the rest of them scarcely have room to breathe.
Then the high opinion poets have of themselves; then the low one
they have of others; then the enmities, injuries, envies, and
repartees in which they are constantly engaged; then the volubility
with which they impart them; then the rapacity with which they
demand sympathy for them; all this, one may whisper, lest the wits
may overhear us, makes pouring out tea a more precarious and,
indeed, arduous occupation than is generally allowed. Added to
which (we whisper again lest the women may overhear us), there is a
little secret which men share among them; Lord Chesterfield
whispered it to his son with strict injunctions to secrecy, ‘Women
are but children of a larger growth… A man of sense only trifles
with them, plays with them, humours and flatters them’, which,
since children always hear what they are not meant to, and
sometimes, even, grow up, may have somehow leaked out, so that the
whole ceremony of pouring out tea is a curious one. A woman knows
very well that, though a wit sends her his poems, praises her
judgment, solicits her criticism, and drinks her tea, this by no
means signifies that he respects her opinions, admires her
understanding, or will refuse, though the rapier is denied him, to
run her through the body with his pen. All this, we say, whisper it
as low as we can, may have leaked out by now; so that even with the
cream jug suspended and the sugar tongs distended the ladies may
fidget a little, look out of the window a little, yawn a little,
and so let the sugar fall with a great plop — as Orlando did now —
into Mr Pope’s tea. Never was any mortal so ready to suspect an
insult or so quick to avenge one as Mr Pope. He turned to Orlando
and presented her instantly with the rough draught of a certain
famous line in the ‘Characters of Women’. Much polish was
afterwards bestowed on it, but even in the original it was striking
enough. Orlando received it with a curtsey. Mr Pope left her with a
bow. Orlando, to cool her cheeks, for really she felt as if the
little man had struck her, strolled in the nut grove at the bottom
of the garden. Soon the cool breezes did their work. To her
amazement she found that she was hugely relieved to find herself
alone. She watched the merry boatloads rowing up the river. No
doubt the sight put her in mind of one or two incidents in her past
life. She sat herself down in profound meditation beneath a fine
willow tree. There she sat till the stars were in the sky. Then she
rose, turned, and went into the house, where she sought her bedroom
and locked the door. Now she opened a cupboard in which hung still
many of the clothes she had worn as a young man of fashion, and
from among them she chose a black velvet suit richly trimmed with
Venetian lace. It was a little out of fashion, indeed, but it
fitted her to perfection and dressed in it she looked the very
figure of a noble Lord. She took a turn or two before the mirror to
make sure that her petticoats had not lost her the freedom of her
legs, and then let herself secretly out of doors.</p>
<p>It was a fine night early in April. A myriad stars mingling with
the light of a sickle moon, which again was enforced by the street
lamps, made a light infinitely becoming to the human countenance
and to the architecture of Mr Wren. Everything appeared in its
tenderest form, yet, just as it seemed on the point of dissolution,
some drop of silver sharpened it to animation. Thus it was that
talk should be, thought Orlando (indulging in foolish reverie);
that society should be, that friendship should be, that love should
be. For, Heaven knows why, just as we have lost faith in human
intercourse some random collocation of barns and trees or a
haystack and a waggon presents us with so perfect a symbol of what
is unattainable that we begin the search again.</p>
<p>She entered Leicester Square as she made these observations. The
buildings had an airy yet formal symmetry not theirs by day. The
canopy of the sky seemed most dexterously washed in to fill up the
outline of roof and chimney. A young woman who sat dejectedly with
one arm drooping by her side, the other reposing in her lap, on a
seat beneath a plane tree in the middle of the square seemed the
very figure of grace, simplicity, and desolation. Orlando swept her
hat off to her in the manner of a gallant paying his addresses to a
lady of fashion in a public place. The young woman raised her head.
It was of the most exquisite shapeliness. The young woman raised
her eyes. Orlando saw them to be of a lustre such as is sometimes
seen on teapots but rarely in a human face. Through this silver
glaze the young woman looked up at him (for a man he was to her)
appealing, hoping, trembling, fearing. She rose; she accepted his
arm. For — need we stress the point? — she was of the tribe which
nightly burnishes their wares, and sets them in order on the common
counter to wait the highest bidder. She led Orlando to the room in
Gerrard Street which was her lodging. To feel her hanging lightly
yet like a suppliant on her arm, roused in Orlando all the feelings
which become a man. She looked, she felt, she talked like one. Yet,
having been so lately a woman herself, she suspected that the
girl’s timidity and her hesitating answers and the very fumbling
with the key in the latch and the fold of her cloak and the droop
of her wrist were all put on to gratify her masculinity. Upstairs
they went, and the pains which the poor creature had been at to
decorate her room and hide the fact that she had no other deceived
Orlando not a moment. The deception roused her scorn; the truth
roused her pity. One thing showing through the other bred the
oddest assortment of feeling, so that she did not know whether to
laugh or to cry. Meanwhile Nell, as the girl called herself,
unbuttoned her gloves; carefully concealed the left-hand thumb,
which wanted mending; then drew behind a screen, where, perhaps,
she rouged her cheeks, arranged her clothes, fixed a new kerchief
round her neck — all the time prattling as women do, to amuse her
lover, though Orlando could have sworn, from the tone of her voice,
that her thoughts were elsewhere. When all was ready, out she came,
prepared — but here Orlando could stand it no longer. In the
strangest torment of anger, merriment, and pity she flung off all
disguise and admitted herself a woman.</p>
<p>At this, Nell burst into such a roar of laughter as might have
been heard across the way.</p>
<p>‘Well, my dear,’ she said, when she had somewhat recovered, ‘I’m
by no means sorry to hear it. For the plain Dunstable of the matter
is’ (and it was remarkable how soon, on discovering that they were
of the same sex, her manner changed and she dropped her plaintive,
appealing ways), ‘the plain Dunstable of the matter is, that I’m
not in the mood for the society of the other sex to-night. Indeed,
I’m in the devil of a fix.’ Whereupon, drawing up the fire and
stirring a bowl of punch, she told Orlando the whole story of her
life. Since it is Orlando’s life that engages us at present, we
need not relate the adventures of the other lady, but it is certain
that Orlando had never known the hours speed faster or more
merrily, though Mistress Nell had not a particle of wit about her,
and when the name of Mr Pope came up in talk asked innocently if he
were connected with the perruque maker of that name in Jermyn
Street. Yet, to Orlando, such is the charm of ease and the
seduction of beauty, this poor girl’s talk, larded though it was
with the commonest expressions of the street corners, tasted like
wine after the fine phrases she had been used to, and she was
forced to the conclusion that there was something in the sneer of
Mr Pope, in the condescension of Mr Addison, and in the secret of
Lord Chesterfield which took away her relish for the society of
wits, deeply though she must continue to respect their works.</p>
<p>These poor creatures, she ascertained, for Nell brought Prue,
and Prue Kitty, and Kitty Rose, had a society of their own of which
they now elected her a member. Each would tell the story of the
adventures which had landed her in her present way of life. Several
were the natural daughters of earls and one was a good deal nearer
than she should have been to the King’s person. None was too
wretched or too poor but to have some ring or handkerchief in her
pocket which stood her in lieu of pedigree. So they would draw
round the punch-bowl which Orlando made it her business to furnish
generously, and many were the fine tales they told and many the
amusing observations they made, for it cannot be denied that when
women get together — but hist — they are always careful to see that
the doors are shut and that not a word of it gets into print. All
they desire is — but hist again — is that not a man’s step on the
stair? All they desire, we were about to say when the gentleman
took the very words out of our mouths. Women have no desires, says
this gentleman, coming into Nell’s parlour; only affectations.
Without desires (she has served him and he is gone) their
conversation cannot be of the slightest interest to anyone. ‘It is
well known’, says Mr S. W., ‘that when they lack the stimulus of
the other sex, women can find nothing to say to each other. When
they are alone, they do not talk, they scratch.’ And since they
cannot talk together and scratching cannot continue without
interruption and it is well known (Mr T. R. has proved it) ‘that
women are incapable of any feeling of affection for their own sex
and hold each other in the greatest aversion’, what can we suppose
that women do when they seek out each other’s society?</p>
<p>As that is not a question that can engage the attention of a
sensible man, let us, who enjoy the immunity of all biographers and
historians from any sex whatever, pass it over, and merely state
that Orlando professed great enjoyment in the society of her own
sex, and leave it to the gentlemen to prove, as they are very fond
of doing, that this is impossible.</p>
<p>But to give an exact and particular account of Orlando’s life at
this time becomes more and more out of the question. As we peer and
grope in the ill-lit, ill-paved, ill-ventilated courtyards that lay
about Gerrard Street and Drury Lane at that time, we seem now to
catch sight of her and then again to lose it. The task is made
still more difficult by the fact that she found it convenient at
this time to change frequently from one set of clothes to another.
Thus she often occurs in contemporary memoirs as ‘Lord’ So-and-so,
who was in fact her cousin; her bounty is ascribed to him, and it
is he who is said to have written the poems that were really hers.
She had, it seems, no difficulty in sustaining the different parts,
for her sex changed far more frequently than those who have worn
only one set of clothing can conceive; nor can there be any doubt
that she reaped a twofold harvest by this device; the pleasures of
life were increased and its experiences multiplied. For the probity
of breeches she exchanged the seductiveness of petticoats and
enjoyed the love of both sexes equally.</p>
<p>So then one may sketch her spending her morning in a China robe
of ambiguous gender among her books; then receiving a client or two
(for she had many scores of suppliants) in the same garment; then
she would take a turn in the garden and clip the nut trees — for
which knee-breeches were convenient; then she would change into a
flowered taffeta which best suited a drive to Richmond and a
proposal of marriage from some great nobleman; and so back again to
town, where she would don a snuff-coloured gown like a lawyer’s and
visit the courts to hear how her cases were doing — for her fortune
was wasting hourly and the suits seemed no nearer consummation than
they had been a hundred years ago; and so, finally, when night
came, she would more often than not become a nobleman complete from
head to toe and walk the streets in search of adventure.</p>
<p>Returning from some of these junketings — of which there were
many stories told at the time, as, that she fought a duel, served
on one of the King’s ships as a captain, was seen to dance naked on
a balcony, and fled with a certain lady to the Low Countries where
the lady’s husband followed them — but of the truth or otherwise of
these stories, we express no opinion — returning from whatever her
occupation may have been, she made a point sometimes of passing
beneath the windows of a coffee house, where she could see the wits
without being seen, and thus could fancy from their gestures what
wise, witty, or spiteful things they were saying without hearing a
word of them; which was perhaps an advantage; and once she stood
half an hour watching three shadows on the blind drinking tea
together in a house in Bolt Court.</p>
<p>Never was any play so absorbing. She wanted to cry out, Bravo!
Bravo! For, to be sure, what a fine drama it was — what a page torn
from the thickest volume of human life! There was the little shadow
with the pouting lips, fidgeting this way and that on his chair,
uneasy, petulant, officious; there was the bent female shadow,
crooking a finger in the cup to feel how deep the tea was, for she
was blind; and there was the Roman-looking rolling shadow in the
big armchair — he who twisted his fingers so oddly and jerked his
head from side to side and swallowed down the tea in such vast
gulps. Dr Johnson, Mr Boswell, and Mrs Williams — those were the
shadows’ names. So absorbed was she in the sight, that she forgot
to think how other ages would have envied her, though it seems
probable that on this occasion they would. She was content to gaze
and gaze. At length Mr Boswell rose. He saluted the old woman with
tart asperity. But with what humility did he not abase himself
before the great Roman shadow, who now rose to its full height and
rocking somewhat as he stood there rolled out the most magnificent
phrases that ever left human lips; so Orlando thought them, though
she never heard a word that any of the three shadows said as they
sat there drinking tea.</p>
<p>At length she came home one night after one of these saunterings
and mounted to her bedroom. She took off her laced coat and stood
there in shirt and breeches looking out of the window. There was
something stirring in the air which forbade her to go to bed. A
white haze lay over the town, for it was a frosty night in
midwinter and a magnificent vista lay all round her. She could see
St Paul’s, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, with all the spires and
domes of the city churches, the smooth bulk of its banks, the
opulent and ample curves of its halls and meeting-places. On the
north rose the smooth, shorn heights of Hampstead, and in the west
the streets and squares of Mayfair shone out in one clear radiance.
Upon this serene and orderly prospect the stars looked down,
glittering, positive, hard, from a cloudless sky. In the extreme
clearness of the atmosphere the line of every roof, the cowl of
every chimney, was perceptible; even the cobbles in the streets
showed distinct one from another, and Orlando could not help
comparing this orderly scene with the irregular and huddled
purlieus which had been the city of London in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. Then, she remembered, the city, if such one could call
it, lay crowded, a mere huddle and conglomeration of houses, under
her windows at Blackfriars. The stars reflected themselves in deep
pits of stagnant water which lay in the middle of the streets. A
black shadow at the corner where the wine shop used to stand was,
as likely as not, the corpse of a murdered man. She could remember
the cries of many a one wounded in such night brawlings, when she
was a little boy, held to the diamond-paned window in her nurse’s
arms. Troops of ruffians, men and women, unspeakably interlaced,
lurched down the streets, trolling out wild songs with jewels
flashing in their ears, and knives gleaming in their fists. On such
a night as this the impermeable tangle of the forests on Highgate
and Hampstead would be outlined, writhing in contorted intricacy
against the sky. Here and there, on one of the hills which rose
above London, was a stark gallows tree, with a corpse nailed to rot
or parch on its cross; for danger and insecurity, lust and
violence, poetry and filth swarmed over the tortuous Elizabethan
highways and buzzed and stank — Orlando could remember even now the
smell of them on a hot night — in the little rooms and narrow
pathways of the city. Now — she leant out of her window — all was
light, order, and serenity. There was the faint rattle of a coach
on the cobbles. She heard the far-away cry of the night watchman
—’Just twelve o’clock on a frosty morning’. No sooner had the words
left his lips than the first stroke of midnight sounded. Orlando
then for the first time noticed a small cloud gathered behind the
dome of St Paul’s. As the strokes sounded, the cloud increased, and
she saw it darken and spread with extraordinary speed. At the same
time a light breeze rose and by the time the sixth stroke of
midnight had struck the whole of the eastern sky was covered with
an irregular moving darkness, though the sky to the west and north
stayed clear as ever. Then the cloud spread north. Height upon
height above the city was engulfed by it. Only Mayfair, with all
its lights shining. burnt more brilliantly than ever by contrast.
With the eighth stroke, some hurrying tatters of cloud sprawled
over Piccadilly. They seemed to mass themselves and to advance with
extraordinary rapidity towards the west end. As the ninth, tenth,
and eleventh strokes struck, a huge blackness sprawled over the
whole of London. With the twelfth stroke of midnight, the darkness
was complete. A turbulent welter of cloud covered the city. All was
darkness; all was doubt; all was confusion. The Eighteenth century
was over; the Nineteenth century had begun.</p>
