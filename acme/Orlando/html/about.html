<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Virginia Woolf (January 25, 1882–March 28, 1941) was an
English novelist and essayist regarded as one of the foremost
modernist literary figures of the twentieth century. During the
interwar period, Woolf was a significant figure in London literary
society and a member of the Bloomsbury Group. Her most famous works
include the novels <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> (1925), <i>To the Lighthouse</i> (1927),
and <i>Orlando</i> (1928), and the book-length essay <i>A Room of One's Own</i>
(1929) with its famous dictum, “a woman must have money and a room
of her own if she is to write fiction”.</p>
