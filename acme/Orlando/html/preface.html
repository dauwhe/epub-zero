<h1>Preface</h1>
</div>

<p>Many friends have helped me in writing this book. Some are dead
and so illustrious that I scarcely dare name them, yet no one can
read or write without being perpetually in the debt of Defoe, Sir
Thomas Browne, Sterne, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Macaulay, Emily
Bronte, De Quincey, and Walter Pater — to name the first that come
to mind. Others are alive, and though perhaps as illustrious in
their own way, are less formidable for that very reason. I am
specially indebted to Mr C.P. Sanger, without whose knowledge of
the law of real property this book could never have been written.
Mr Sydney-Turner’s wide and peculiar erudition has saved me, I
hope, some lamentable blunders. I have had the advantage — how
great I alone can estimate — of Mr Arthur Waley’s knowledge of
Chinese. Madame Lopokova (Mrs J.M. Keynes) has been at hand to
correct my Russian. To the unrivalled sympathy and imagination of
Mr Roger Fry I owe whatever understanding of the art of painting I
may possess. I have, I hope, profited in another department by the
singularly penetrating, if severe, criticism of my nephew Mr Julian
Bell. Miss M.K. Snowdon’s indefatigable researches in the archives
of Harrogate and Cheltenham were none the less arduous for being
vain. Other friends have helped me in ways too various to specify.
I must content myself with naming Mr Angus Davidson; Mrs
Cartwright; Miss Janet Case; Lord Berners (whose knowledge of
Elizabethan music has proved invaluable); Mr Francis Birrell; my
brother, Dr Adrian Stephen; Mr F.L. Lucas; Mr and Mrs Desmond
Maccarthy; that most inspiriting of critics, my brother-in-law, Mr
Clive Bell; Mr G.H. Rylands; Lady Colefax; Miss Nellie Boxall; Mr
J.M. Keynes; Mr Hugh Walpole; Miss Violet Dickinson; the Hon.
Edward Sackville West; Mr and Mrs St. John Hutchinson; Mr Duncan
Grant; Mr and Mrs Stephen Tomlin; Mr and Lady Ottoline Morrell; my
mother-in-law, Mrs Sydney Woolf; Mr Osbert Sitwell; Madame Jacques
Raverat; Colonel Cory Bell; Miss Valerie Taylor; Mr J.T. Sheppard;
Mr and Mrs T.S. Eliot; Miss Ethel Sands; Miss Nan Hudson; my nephew
Mr Quentin Bell (an old and valued collaborator in fiction); Mr
Raymond Mortimer; Lady Gerald Wellesley; Mr Lytton Strachey; the
Viscountess Cecil; Miss Hope Mirrlees; Mr E.M. Forster; the Hon.
Harold Nicolson; and my sister, Vanessa Bell — but the list
threatens to grow too long and is already far too distinguished.
For while it rouses in me memories of the pleasantest kind it will
inevitably wake expectations in the reader which the book itself
can only disappoint. Therefore I will conclude by thanking the
officials of the British Museum and Record Office for their wonted
courtesy; my niece Miss Angelica Bell, for a service which none but
she could have rendered; and my husband for the patience with which
he has invariably helped my researches and for the profound
historical knowledge to which these pages owe whatever degree of
accuracy they may attain. Finally, I would thank, had I not lost
his name and address, a gentleman in America, who has generously
and gratuitously corrected the punctuation, the botany, the
entomology, the geography, and the chronology of previous works of
mine and will, I hope, not spare his services on the present
occasion.</p>
