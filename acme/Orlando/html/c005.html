<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
</div>


<p>The great cloud which hung, not
only over London, but over the whole of the British Isles on the
first day of the nineteenth century stayed, or rather, did not
stay, for it was buffeted about constantly by blustering gales,
long enough to have extraordinary consequences upon those who lived
beneath its shadow. A change seemed to have come over the climate
of England. Rain fell frequently, but only in fitful gusts, which
were no sooner over than they began again. The sun shone, of
course, but it was so girt about with clouds and the air was so
saturated with water, that its beams were discoloured and purples,
oranges, and reds of a dull sort took the place of the more
positive landscapes of the eighteenth century. Under this bruised
and sullen canopy the green of the cabbages was less intense, and
the white of the snow was muddied. But what was worse, damp now
began to make its way into every house — damp, which is the most
insidious of all enemies, for while the sun can be shut out by
blinds, and the frost roasted by a hot fire, damp steals in while
we sleep; damp is silent, imperceptible, ubiquitous. Damp swells
the wood, furs the kettle, rusts the iron, rots the stone. So
gradual is the process, that it is not until we pick up some chest
of drawers, or coal scuttle, and the whole thing drops to pieces in
our hands, that we suspect even that the disease is at work.</p>
<p>Thus, stealthily and imperceptibly, none marking the exact day
or hour of the change, the constitution of England was altered and
nobody knew it. Everywhere the effects were felt. The hardy country
gentleman, who had sat down gladly to a meal of ale and beef in a
room designed, perhaps by the brothers Adam, with classic dignity,
now felt chilly. Rugs appeared; beards were grown; trousers were
fastened tight under the instep. The chill which he felt in his
legs the country gentleman soon transferred to his house; furniture
was muffled; walls and tables were covered; nothing was left bare.
Then a change of diet became essential. The muffin was invented and
the crumpet. Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and, as
coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a
drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers,
and artificial flowers to mantelpieces, and mantelpieces to
pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and
drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable
little dogs, mats, and china ornaments, the home — which had become
extremely important — was completely altered.</p>
<p>Outside the house — it was another effect of the damp — ivy grew
in unparalleled profusion. Houses that had been of bare stone were
smothered in greenery. No garden, however formal its original
design, lacked a shrubbery, a wilderness, a maze. What light
penetrated to the bedrooms where children were born was naturally
of an obfusc green, and what light penetrated to the drawing-rooms
where grown men and women lived came through curtains of brown and
purple plush. But the change did not stop at outward things. The
damp struck within. Men felt the chill in their hearts; the damp in
their minds. In a desperate effort to snuggle their feelings into
some sort of warmth one subterfuge was tried after another. Love,
birth, and death were all swaddled in a variety of fine phrases.
The sexes drew further and further apart. No open conversation was
tolerated. Evasions and concealments were sedulously practised on
both sides. And just as the ivy and the evergreen rioted in the
damp earth outside, so did the same fertility show itself within.
The life of the average woman was a succession of childbirths. She
married at nineteen and had fifteen or eighteen children by the
time she was thirty; for twins abounded. Thus the British Empire
came into existence; and thus — for there is no stopping damp; it
gets into the inkpot as it gets into the woodwork — sentences
swelled, adjectives multiplied, lyrics became epics, and little
trifles that had been essays a column long were now encyclopaedias
in ten or twenty volumes. But Eusebius Chubb shall be our witness
to the effect this all had upon the mind of a sensitive man who
could do nothing to stop it. There is a passage towards the end of
his memoirs where he describes how, after writing thirty-five folio
pages one morning ‘all about nothing’ he screwed the lid of his
inkpot and went for a turn in his garden. Soon he found himself
involved in the shrubbery. Innumerable leaves creaked and glistened
above his head. He seemed to himself ‘to crush the mould of a
million more under his feet’. Thick smoke exuded from a damp
bonfire at the end of the garden. He reflected that no fire on
earth could ever hope to consume that vast vegetable encumbrance.
Wherever he looked, vegetation was rampant. Cucumbers ‘came
scrolloping across the grass to his feet’. Giant cauliflowers
towered deck above deck till they rivalled, to his disordered
imagination, the elm trees themselves. Hens laid incessantly eggs
of no special tint. Then, remembering with a sigh his own fecundity
and his poor wife Jane, now in the throes of her fifteenth
confinement indoors, how, he asked himself, could he blame the
fowls? He looked upwards into the sky. Did not heaven itself, or
that great frontispiece of heaven, which is the sky, indicate the
assent, indeed, the instigation of the heavenly hierarchy? For
there, winter or summer, year in year out, the clouds turned and
tumbled, like whales, he pondered, or elephants rather; but no,
there was no escaping the simile which was pressed upon him from a
thousand airy acres; the whole sky itself as it spread wide above
the British Isles was nothing but a vast feather bed; and the
undistinguished fecundity of the garden, the bedroom and the
henroost was copied there. He went indoors, wrote the passage
quoted above, laid his head in a gas oven, and when they found him
later he was past revival.</p>
<p>While this went on in every part of England, it was all very
well for Orlando to mew herself in her house at Blackfriars and
pretend that the climate was the same; that one could still say
what one liked and wear knee-breeches or skirts as the fancy took
one. Even she, at length, was forced to acknowledge that times were
changed. One afternoon in the early part of the century she was
driving through St James’s Park in her old panelled coach when one
of those sunbeams, which occasionally, though not often, managed to
come to earth, struggled through, marbling the clouds with strange
prismatic colours as it passed. Such a sight was sufficiently
strange after the clear and uniform skies of the eighteenth century
to cause her to pull the window down and look at it. The puce and
flamingo clouds made her think with a pleasurable anguish, which
proves that she was insensibly afflicted with the damp already, of
dolphins dying in Ionian seas. But what was her surprise when, as
it struck the earth, the sunbeam seemed to call forth, or to light
up, a pyramid, hecatomb, or trophy (for it had something of a
banquet-table air)— a conglomeration at any rate of the most
heterogeneous and ill-assorted objects, piled higgledy-piggledy in
a vast mound where the statue of Queen Victoria now stands! Draped
about a vast cross of fretted and floriated gold were widow’s weeds
and bridal veils; hooked on to other excrescences were crystal
palaces, bassinettes, military helmets, memorial wreaths, trousers,
whiskers, wedding cakes, cannon, Christmas trees, telescopes,
extinct monsters, globes, maps, elephants, and mathematical
instruments — the whole supported like a gigantic coat of arms on
the right side by a female figure clothed in flowing white; on the
left by a portly gentleman wearing a frock-coat and sponge-bag
trousers. The incongruity of the objects, the association of the
fully clothed and the partly draped, the garishness of the
different colours and their plaid-like juxtapositions afflicted
Orlando with the most profound dismay. She had never, in all her
life, seen anything at once so indecent, so hideous, and so
monumental. It might, and indeed it must be, the effect of the sun
on the water-logged air; it would vanish with the first breeze that
blew; but for all that, it looked, as she drove past, as if it were
destined to endure for ever. Nothing, she felt, sinking back into
the corner of her coach, no wind, rain, sun, or thunder, could ever
demolish that garish erection. Only the noses would mottle and the
trumpets would rust; but there they would remain, pointing east,
west, south, and north, eternally. She looked back as her coach
swept up Constitution Hill. Yes, there it was, still beaming
placidly in a light which — she pulled her watch out of her fob —
was, of course, the light of twelve o’clock mid-day. None other
could be so prosaic, so matter-of-fact, so impervious to any hint
of dawn or sunset, so seemingly calculated to last for ever. She
was determined not to look again. Already she felt the tides of her
blood run sluggishly. But what was more peculiar a blush, vivid and
singular, overspread her cheeks as she passed Buckingham Palace and
her eyes seemed forced by a superior power down upon her knees.
Suddenly she saw with a start that she was wearing black breeches.
She never ceased blushing till she had reached her country house,
which, considering the time it takes four horses to trot thirty
miles, will be taken, we hope, as a signal proof of her
chastity.</p>
<p>Once there, she followed what had now become the most imperious
need of her nature and wrapped herself as well as she could in a
damask quilt which she snatched from her bed. She explained to the
Widow Bartholomew (who had succeeded good old Grimsditch as
housekeeper) that she felt chilly.</p>
<p>‘So do we all, m’lady,’ said the Widow, heaving a profound sigh.
‘The walls is sweating,’ she said, with a curious, lugubrious
complacency, and sure enough, she had only to lay her hand on the
oak panels for the finger-prints to be marked there. The ivy had
grown so profusely that many windows were now sealed up. The
kitchen was so dark that they could scarcely tell a kettle from a
cullender. A poor black cat had been mistaken for coals and
shovelled on the fire. Most of the maids were already wearing three
or four red-flannel petticoats, though the month was August.</p>
<p>‘But is it true, m’lady,’ the good woman asked, hugging herself,
while the golden crucifix heaved on her bosom, ‘that the Queen,
bless her, is wearing a what d’you call it, a — ’ the good woman
hesitated and blushed.</p>
<p>‘A crinoline,’ Orlando helped her out with it (for the word had
reached Blackfriars). Mrs Bartholomew nodded. The tears were
already running down her cheeks, but as she wept she smiled. For it
was pleasant to weep. Were they not all of them weak women? wearing
crinolines the better to conceal the fact; the great fact; the only
fact; but, nevertheless, the deplorable fact; which every modest
woman did her best to deny until denial was impossible; the fact
that she was about to bear a child? to bear fifteen or twenty
children indeed, so that most of a modest woman’s life was spent,
after all, in denying what, on one day at least of every year, was
made obvious.</p>
<p>‘The muffins is keepin’ ‘ot,’ said Mrs Bartholomew, mopping up
her tears, ‘in the liberry.’</p>
<p>And wrapped in a damask bed quilt, to a dish of muffins Orlando
now sat down.</p>
<p>‘The muffins is keepin’ ‘ot in the liberry’— Orlando minced out
the horrid cockney phrase in Mrs Bartholomew’s refined cockney
accents as she drank — but no, she detested the mild fluid — her
tea. It was in this very room, she remembered, that Queen Elizabeth
had stood astride the fireplace with a flagon of beer in her hand,
which she suddenly dashed on the table when Lord Burghley
tactlessly used the imperative instead of the subjunctive. ‘Little
man, little man,’— Orlando could hear her say —’is “must” a word to
be addressed to princes?’ And down came the flagon on the table:
there was the mark of it still.</p>
<p>But when Orlando leapt to her feet, as the mere thought of that
great Queen commanded, the bed quilt tripped her up, and she fell
back in her arm-chair with a curse. Tomorrow she would have to buy
twenty yards or more of black bombazine, she supposed, to make a
skirt. And then (here she blushed), she would have to buy a
crinoline, and then (here she blushed) a bassinette, and then
another crinoline, and so on… The blushes came and went with the
most exquisite iteration of modesty and shame imaginable. One might
see the spirit of the age blowing, now hot, now cold, upon her
cheeks. And if the spirit of the age blew a little unequally, the
crinoline being blushed for before the husband, her ambiguous
position must excuse her (even her sex was still in dispute) and
the irregular life she had lived before.</p>
<p>At length the colour on her cheeks resumed its stability and it
seemed as if the spirit of the age — if such indeed it were — lay
dormant for a time. Then Orlando felt in the bosom of her shirt as
if for some locket or relic of lost affection, and drew out no such
thing, but a roll of paper, sea-stained, blood-stained,
travel-stained — the manuscript of her poem, ‘The Oak Tree’. She
had carried this about with her for so many years now, and in such
hazardous circumstances, that many of the pages were stained, some
were torn, while the straits she had been in for writing paper when
with the gipsies, had forced her to overscore the margins and cross
the lines till the manuscript looked like a piece of darning most
conscientiously carried out. She turned back to the first page and
read the date, 1586, written in her own boyish hand. She had been
working at it for close three hundred years now. It was time to
make an end. Meanwhile she began turning and dipping and reading
and skipping and thinking as she read, how very little she had
changed all these years. She had been a gloomy boy, in love with
death, as boys are; and then she had been amorous and florid; and
then she had been sprightly and satirical; and sometimes she had
tried prose and sometimes she had tried drama. Yet through all
these changes she had remained, she reflected, fundamentally the
same. She had the same brooding meditative temper, the same love of
animals and nature, the same passion for the country and the
seasons.</p>
<p>‘After all,’ she thought, getting up and going to the window,
‘nothing has changed. The house, the garden are precisely as they
were. Not a chair has been moved, not a trinket sold. There are the
same walks, the same lawns, the same trees, and the same pool,
which, I dare say, has the same carp in it. True, Queen Victoria is
on the throne and not Queen Elizabeth, but what difference… ’</p>
<p>No sooner had the thought taken shape, than, as if to rebuke it,
the door was flung wide and in marched Basket, the butler, followed
by Bartholomew, the housekeeper, to clear away tea. Orlando, who
had just dipped her pen in the ink, and was about to indite some
reflection upon the eternity of all things, was much annoyed to be
impeded by a blot, which spread and meandered round her pen. It was
some infirmity of the quill, she supposed; it was split or dirty.
She dipped it again. The blot increased. She tried to go on with
what she was saying; no words came. Next she began to decorate the
blot with wings and whiskers, till it became a round-headed
monster, something between a bat and a wombat. But as for writing
poetry with Basket and Bartholomew in the room, it was impossible.
No sooner had she said ‘Impossible’ than, to her astonishment and
alarm, the pen began to curve and caracole with the smoothest
possible fluency. Her page was written in the neatest sloping
Italian hand with the most insipid verse she had ever read in her
life:</p>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I am myself but a vile link</p>
<p>Amid life’s weary chain,</p>
<p>But I have spoken hallow’d words,</p>
<p>Oh, do not say in vain!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Will the young maiden, when her tears,</p>
<p>Alone in moonlight shine,</p>
<p>Tears for the absent and the loved,</p>
<p>Murmur&#160;—</p>
</div>
<p>she wrote without a stop as Bartholomew and Basket grunted and
groaned about the room, mending the fire, picking up the
muffins.</p>
<p>Again she dipped her pen and off it went:—</p>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She was so changed, the soft carnation cloud</p>
<p>Once mantling o’er her cheek like that which eve</p>
<p>Hangs o’er the sky, glowing with roseate hue,</p>
<p>Had faded into paleness, broken by</p>
<p>Bright burning blushes, torches of the tomb,</p>
</div>
<p>but here, by an abrupt movement she spilt the ink ever the page
and blotted it from human sight she hoped for ever. She was all of
a quiver, all of a stew. Nothing more repulsive could be imagined
than to feel the ink flowing thus in cascades of involuntary
inspiration. What had happened to her? Was it the damp, was it
Bartholomew, was it Basket, what was it? she demanded. But the room
was empty. No one answered her, unless the dripping of the rain in
the ivy could be taken for an answer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she became conscious, as she stood at the window, of
an extraordinary tingling and vibration all over her, as if she
were made of a thousand wires upon which some breeze or errant
fingers were playing scales. Now her toes tingled; now her marrow.
She had the queerest sensations about the thigh bones. Her hairs
seemed to erect themselves. Her arms sang and twanged as the
telegraph wires would be singing and twanging in twenty years or
so. But all this agitation seemed at length to concentrate in her
hands; and then in one hand, and then in one finger of that hand,
and then finally to contract itself so that it made a ring of
quivering sensibility about the second finger of the left hand. And
when she raised it to see what caused this agitation, she saw
nothing — nothing but the vast solitary emerald which Queen
Elizabeth had given her. And was that not enough? she asked. It was
of the finest water. It was worth ten thousand pounds at least. The
vibration seemed, in the oddest way (but remember we are dealing
with some of the darkest manifestations of the human soul) to say
No, that is not enough; and, further, to assume a note of
interrogation, as though it were asking, what did it mean, this
hiatus, this strange oversight? till poor Orlando felt positively
ashamed of the second finger of her left hand without in the least
knowing why. At this moment, Bartholomew came in to ask which dress
she should lay out for dinner, and Orlando, whose senses were much
quickened, instantly glanced at Bartholomew’s left hand, and
instantly perceived what she had never noticed before — a thick
ring of rather jaundiced yellow circling the third finger where her
own was bare.</p>
<p>‘Let me look at your ring, Bartholomew,’ she said, stretching
her hand to take it.</p>
<p>At this, Bartholomew made as if she had been struck in the
breast by a rogue. She started back a pace or two, clenched her
hand and flung it away from her with a gesture that was noble in
the extreme. ‘No,’ she said, with resolute dignity, her Ladyship
might look if she pleased, but as for taking off her wedding ring,
not the Archbishop nor the Pope nor Queen Victoria on her throne
could force her to do that. Her Thomas had put it on her finger
twenty-five years, six months, three weeks ago; she had slept in
it; worked in it; washed in it; prayed in it; and proposed to be
buried in it. In fact, Orlando understood her to say, but her voice
was much broken with emotion; that it was by the gleam on her
wedding ring that she would be assigned her station among the
angels and its lustre would be tarnished for ever if she let it out
of her keeping for a second.</p>
<p>‘Heaven help us,’ said Orlando, standing at the window and
watching the pigeons at their pranks, ‘what a world we live in!
What a world to be sure!’ Its complexities amazed her. It now
seemed to her that the whole world was ringed with gold. She went
in to dinner. Wedding rings abounded. She went to church. Wedding
rings were everywhere. She drove out. Gold, or pinchbeck, thin,
thick, plain, smooth, they glowed dully on every hand. Rings filled
the jewellers’ shops, not the flashing pastes and diamonds of
Orlando’s recollection, but simple bands without a stone in them.
At the same time, she began to notice a new habit among the town
people. In the old days, one would meet a boy trifling with a girl
under a hawthorn hedge frequently enough. Orlando had flicked many
a couple with the tip of her whip and laughed and passed on. Now,
all that was changed. Couples trudged and plodded in the middle of
the road indissolubly linked together. The woman’s right hand was
invariably passed through the man’s left and her fingers were
firmly gripped by his. Often it was not till the horses’ noses were
on them that they budged, and then, though they moved it was all in
one piece, heavily, to the side of the road. Orlando could only
suppose that some new discovery had been made about the race; that
they were somehow stuck together, couple after couple, but who had
made it and when, she could not guess. It did not seem to be
Nature. She looked at the doves and the rabbits and the elk-hounds
and she could not see that Nature had changed her ways or mended
them, since the time of Elizabeth at least. There was no
indissoluble alliance among the brutes that she could see. Could it
be Queen Victoria then, or Lord Melbourne? Was it from them that
the great discovery of marriage proceeded? Yet the Queen, she
pondered, was said to be fond of dogs, and Lord Melbourne, she had
heard, was said to be fond of women. It was strange — it was
distasteful; indeed, there was something in this indissolubility of
bodies which was repugnant to her sense of decency and sanitation.
Her ruminations, however, were accompanied by such a tingling and
twanging of the afflicted finger that she could scarcely keep her
ideas in order. They were languishing and ogling like a housemaid’s
fancies. They made her blush. There was nothing for it but to buy
one of those ugly bands and wear it like the rest. This she did,
slipping it, overcome with shame, upon her finger in the shadow of
a curtain; but without avail. The tingling persisted more
violently, more indignantly than ever. She did not sleep a wink
that night. Next morning when she took up the pen to write, either
she could think of nothing, and the pen made one large lachrymose
blot after another, or it ambled off, more alarmingly still, into
mellifluous fluencies about early death and corruption, which were
worse than no thinking at all. For it would seem — her case proved
it — that we write, not with the fingers, but with the whole
person. The nerve which controls the pen winds itself about every
fibre of our being, threads the heart, pierces the liver. Though
the seat of her trouble seemed to be the left hand, she could feel
herself poisoned through and through, and was forced at length to
consider the most desperate of remedies, which was to yield
completely and submissively to the spirit of the age, and take a
husband.</p>
<p>That this was much against her natural temperament has been
sufficiently made plain. When the sound of the Archduke’s chariot
wheels died away, the cry that rose to her lips was ‘Life! A
Lover!’ not ‘Life! A Husband!’ and it was in pursuit of this aim
that she had gone to town and run about the world as has been shown
in the previous chapter. Such is the indomitable nature of the
spirit of the age, however, that it batters down anyone who tries
to make stand against it far more effectually than those who bend
its own way. Orlando had inclined herself naturally to the
Elizabethan spirit, to the Restoration spirit, to the spirit of the
eighteenth century, and had in consequence scarcely been aware of
the change from one age to the other. But the spirit of the
nineteenth century was antipathetic to her in the extreme, and thus
it took her and broke her, and she was aware of her defeat at its
hands as she had never been before. For it is probable that the
human spirit has its place in time assigned to it; some are born of
this age, some of that; and now that Orlando was grown a woman, a
year or two past thirty indeed, the lines of her character were
fixed, and to bend them the wrong way was intolerable.</p>
<p>So she stood mournfully at the drawing-room window (Bartholomew
had so christened the library) dragged down by the weight of the
crinoline which she had submissively adopted. It was heavier and
more drab than any dress she had yet worn. None had ever so impeded
her movements. No longer could she stride through the garden with
her dogs, or run lightly to the high mound and fling herself
beneath the oak tree. Her skirts collected damp leaves and straw.
The plumed hat tossed on the breeze. The thin shoes were quickly
soaked and mud-caked. Her muscles had lost their pliancy. She
became nervous lest there should be robbers behind the wainscot and
afraid, for the first time in her life, of ghosts in the corridors.
All these things inclined her, step by step, to submit to the new
discovery, whether Queen Victoria’s or another’s, that each man and
each woman has another allotted to it for life, whom it supports,
by whom it is supported, till death them do part. It would be a
comfort, she felt, to lean; to sit down; yes, to lie down; never,
never, never to get up again. Thus did the spirit work upon her,
for all her past pride, and as she came sloping down the scale of
emotion to this lowly and unaccustomed lodging-place, those
twangings and tinglings which had been so captious and so
interrogative modulated into the sweetest melodies, till it seemed
as if angels were plucking harp-strings with white fingers and her
whole being was pervaded by a seraphic harmony.</p>
<p>But whom could she lean upon? She asked that question of the
wild autumn winds. For it was now October, and wet as usual. Not
the Archduke; he had married a very great lady and had hunted hares
in Roumania these many years now; nor Mr M.; he was become a
Catholic; nor the Marquis of C.; he made sacks in Botany Bay; nor
the Lord O.; he had long been food for fishes. One way or another,
all her old cronies were gone now, and the Nells and the Kits of
Drury Lane, much though she favoured them, scarcely did to lean
upon.</p>
<p>‘Whom’, she asked, casting her eyes upon the revolving clouds,
clasping her hands as she knelt on the window-sill, and looking the
very image of appealing womanhood as she did so, ‘can I lean upon?’
Her words formed themselves, her hands clasped themselves,
involuntarily, just as her pen had written of its own accord. It
was not Orlando who spoke, but the spirit of the age. But whichever
it was, nobody answered it. The rooks were tumbling pell-mell among
the violet clouds of autumn. The rain had stopped at last and there
was an iridescence in the sky which tempted her to put on her
plumed hat and her little stringed shoes and stroll out before
dinner.</p>
<p>‘Everyone is mated except myself,’ she mused, as she trailed
disconsolately across the courtyard. There were the rooks; Canute
and Pippin even — transitory as their alliances were, still each
this evening seemed to have a partner. ‘Whereas, I, who am mistress
of it all,’ Orlando thought, glancing as she passed at the
innumerable emblazoned windows of the hall, ‘am single, am
mateless, am alone.’</p>
<p>Such thoughts had never entered her head before. Now they bore
her down unescapably. Instead of thrusting the gate open, she
tapped with a gloved hand for the porter to unfasten it for her.
One must lean on someone, she thought, if it is only on a porter;
and half wished to stay behind and help him to grill his chop on a
bucket of fiery coals, but was too timid to ask it. So she strayed
out into the park alone, faltering at first and apprehensive lest
there might be poachers or gamekeepers or even errand-boys to
marvel that a great lady should walk alone.</p>
<p>At every step she glanced nervously lest some male form should
be hiding behind a furze bush or some savage cow be lowering its
horns to toss her. But there were only the rooks flaunting in the
sky. A steel-blue plume from one of them fell among the heather.
She loved wild birds’ feathers. She had used to collect them as a
boy. She picked it up and stuck it in her hat. The air blew upon
her spirit somewhat and revived it. As the rooks went whirling and
wheeling above her head and feather after feather fell gleaming
through the purplish air, she followed them, her long cloak
floating behind her, over the moor, up the hill. She had not walked
so far for years. Six feathers had she picked from the grass and
drawn between her fingers and pressed to her lips to feel their
smooth, glinting plumage, when she saw, gleaming on the hill-side,
a silver pool, mysterious as the lake into which Sir Bedivere flung
the sword of Arthur. A single feather quivered in the air and fell
into the middle of it. Then, some strange ecstasy came over her.
Some wild notion she had of following the birds to the rim of the
world and flinging herself on the spongy turf and there drinking
forgetfulness, while the rooks’ hoarse laughter sounded over her.
She quickened her pace; she ran; she tripped; the tough heather
roots flung her to the ground. Her ankle was broken. She could not
rise. But there she lay content. The scent of the bog myrtle and
the meadow-sweet was in her nostrils. The rooks’ hoarse laughter
was in her ears. ‘I have found my mate,’ she murmured. ‘It is the
moor. I am nature’s bride,’ she whispered, giving herself in
rapture to the cold embraces of the grass as she lay folded in her
cloak in the hollow by the pool. ‘Here will I lie. (A feather fell
upon her brow.) I have found a greener laurel than the bay. My
forehead will be cool always. These are wild birds’ feathers — the
owl’s, the nightjar’s. I shall dream wild dreams. My hands shall
wear no wedding ring,’ she continued, slipping it from her finger.
‘The roots shall twine about them. Ah!’ she sighed, pressing her
head luxuriously on its spongy pillow, ‘I have sought happiness
through many ages and not found it; fame and missed it; love and
not known it; life — and behold, death is better. I have known many
men and many women,’ she continued; ‘none have I understood. It is
better that I should lie at peace here with only the sky above me —
as the gipsy told me years ago. That was in Turkey.’ And she looked
straight up into the marvellous golden foam into which the clouds
had churned themselves, and saw next moment a track in it, and
camels passing in single file through the rocky desert among clouds
of red dust; and then, when the camels had passed, there were only
mountains, very high and full of clefts and with pinnacles of rock,
and she fancied she heard goat bells ringing in their passes, and
in their folds were fields of irises and gentian. So the sky
changed and her eyes slowly lowered themselves down and down till
they came to the rain-darkened earth and saw the great hump of the
South Downs, flowing in one wave along the coast; and where the
land parted, there was the sea, the sea with ships passing; and she
fancied she heard a gun far out at sea, and thought at first,
‘That’s the Armada,’ and then thought ‘No, it’s Nelson’, and then
remembered how those wars were over and the ships were busy
merchant ships; and the sails on the winding river were those of
pleasure boats. She saw, too, cattle sprinkled on the dark fields,
sheep and cows, and she saw the lights coming here and there in
farm-house windows, and lanterns moving among the cattle as the
shepherd went his rounds and the cowman; and then the lights went
out and the stars rose and tangled themselves about the sky.
Indeed, she was falling asleep with the wet feathers on her face
and her ear pressed to the ground when she heard, deep within, some
hammer on an anvil, or was it a heart beating? Tick-tock,
tick-tock, so it hammered, so it beat, the anvil, or the heart in
the middle of the earth; until, as she listened, she thought it
changed to the trot of a horse’s hoofs; one, two, three, four, she
counted; then she heard a stumble; then, as it came nearer and
nearer, she could hear the crack of a twig and the suck of the wet
bog in its hoofs. The horse was almost on her. She sat upright.
Towering dark against the yellow-slashed sky of dawn, with the
plovers rising and falling about him, she saw a man on horseback.
He started. The horse stopped.</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ the man cried, leaping to the ground, ‘you’re
hurt!’</p>
<p>‘I’m dead, sir!’ she replied.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, they became engaged.</p>
<p>The morning after, as they sat at breakfast, he told her his
name. It was Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine, Esquire.</p>
<p>‘I knew it!’ she said, for there was something romantic and
chivalrous, passionate, melancholy, yet determined about him which
went with the wild, dark-plumed name — a name which had, in her
mind, the steel-blue gleam of rooks’ wings, the hoarse laughter of
their caws, the snake-like twisting descent of their feathers in a
silver pool, and a thousand other things which will be described
presently.</p>
<p>‘Mine is Orlando,’ she said. He had guessed it. For if you see a
ship in full sail coming with the sun on it proudly sweeping across
the Mediterranean from the South Seas, one says at once, ‘Orlando’,
he explained.</p>
<p>In fact, though their acquaintance had been so short, they had
guessed, as always happens between lovers, everything of any
importance about each other in two seconds at the utmost, and it
now remained only to fill in such unimportant details as what they
were called; where they lived; and whether they were beggars or
people of substance. He had a castle in the Hebrides, but it was
ruined, he told her. Gannets feasted in the banqueting hall. He had
been a soldier and a sailor, and had explored the East. He was on
his way now to join his brig at Falmouth, but the wind had fallen
and it was only when the gale blew from the South-west that he
could put out to sea. Orlando looked hastily from the
breakfast-room window at the gilt leopard on the weather vane.
Mercifully its tail pointed due east and was steady as a rock. ‘Oh!
Shel, don’t leave me!’ she cried. ‘I’m passionately in love with
you,’ she said. No sooner had the words left her mouth than an
awful suspicion rushed into both their minds simultaneously.</p>
<p>‘You’re a woman, Shel!’ she cried.</p>
<p>‘You’re a man, Orlando!’ he cried.</p>
<p>Never was there such a scene of protestation and demonstration
as then took place since the world began. When it was over and they
were seated again she asked him, what was this talk of a South-west
gale? Where was he bound for?</p>
<p>‘For the Horn,’ he said briefly, and blushed. (For a man had to
blush as a woman had, only at rather different things.) It was only
by dint of great pressure on her side and the use of much intuition
that she gathered that his life was spent in the most desperate and
splendid of adventures — which is to voyage round Cape Horn in the
teeth of a gale. Masts had been snapped off; sails torn to ribbons
(she had to drag the admission from him). Sometimes the ship had
sunk, and he had been left the only survivor on a raft with a
biscuit.</p>
<p>‘It’s about all a fellow can do nowadays,’ he said sheepishly,
and helped himself to great spoonfuls of strawberry jam. The vision
which she had thereupon of this boy (for he was little more)
sucking peppermints, for which he had a passion, while the masts
snapped and the stars reeled and he roared brief orders to cut this
adrift, to heave that overboard, brought the tears to her eyes,
tears, she noted, of a finer flavour than any she had cried before:
‘I am a woman,’ she thought, ‘a real woman, at last.’ She thanked
Bonthrop from the bottom of her heart for having given her this
rare and unexpected delight. Had she not been lame in the left
foot, she would have sat upon his knee.</p>
<p>‘Shel, my darling,’ she began again, ‘tell me… ’ and so they
talked two hours or more, perhaps about Cape Horn, perhaps not, and
really it would profit little to write down what they said, for
they knew each other so well that they could say anything, which is
tantamount to saying nothing, or saying such stupid, prosy things
as how to cook an omelette, or where to buy the best boots in
London, things which have no lustre taken from their setting, yet
are positively of amazing beauty within it. For it has come about,
by the wise economy of nature, that our modern spirit can almost
dispense with language; the commonest expressions do, since no
expressions do; hence the most ordinary conversation is often the
most poetic, and the most poetic is precisely that which cannot be
written down. For which reasons we leave a great blank here, which
must be taken to indicate that the space is filled to
repletion.</p>
<p>After some days more of this kind of talk,</p>
<p>‘Orlando, my dearest,’ Shel was beginning, when there was a
scuffling outside, and Basket the butler entered with the
information that there was a couple of Peelers downstairs with a
warrant from the Queen.</p>
<p>‘Show ‘em up,’ said Shelmerdine briefly, as if on his own
quarter-deck, taking up, by instinct, a stand with his hands behind
him in front of the fireplace. Two officers in bottlegreen uniforms
with truncheons at their hips then entered the room and stood at
attention. Formalities being over, they gave into Orlando’s own
hands, as their commission was, a legal document of some very
impressive sort; judging by the blobs of sealing wax, the ribbons,
the oaths, and the signatures, which were all of the highest
importance.</p>
<p>Orlando ran her eyes through it and then, using the first finger
of her right hand as pointer, read out the following facts as being
most germane to the matter.</p>
<p>‘The lawsuits are settled,’ she read out… ’some in my favour, as
for example… others not. Turkish marriage annulled (I was
ambassador in Constantinople, Shel,’ she explained) ‘Children
pronounced illegitimate, (they said I had three sons by Pepita, a
Spanish dancer). So they don’t inherit, which is all to the good…
Sex? Ah! what about sex? My sex’, she read out with some solemnity,
‘is pronounced indisputably, and beyond the shadow of a doubt (what
I was telling you a moment ago, Shel?), female. The estates which
are now desequestrated in perpetuity descend and are tailed and
entailed upon the heirs male of my body, or in default of
marriage’— but here she grew impatient with this legal verbiage,
and said, ‘but there won’t be any default of marriage, nor of heirs
either, so the rest can be taken as read.’ Whereupon she appended
her own signature beneath Lord Palmerston’s and entered from that
moment into the undisturbed possession of her titles, her house,
and her estate — which was now so much shrunk, for the cost of the
lawsuits had been prodigious, that, though she was infinitely noble
again, she was also excessively poor.</p>
<p>When the result of the lawsuit was made known (and rumour flew
much quicker than the telegraph which has supplanted it), the whole
town was filled with rejoicings.</p>
<p>[Horses were put into carriages for the sole purpose of being
taken out. Empty barouches and landaus were trundled up and down
the High Street incessantly. Addresses were read from the Bull.
Replies were made from the Stag. The town was illuminated. Gold
caskets were securely sealed in glass cases. Coins were well and
duly laid under stones. Hospitals were founded. Rat and Sparrow
clubs were inaugurated. Turkish women by the dozen were burnt in
effigy in the market-place, together with scores of peasant boys
with the label ‘I am a base Pretender’, lolling from their mouths.
The Queen’s cream-coloured ponies were soon seen trotting up the
avenue with a command to Orlando to dine and sleep at the Castle,
that very same night. Her table, as on a previous occasion, was
snowed under with invitations from the Countess if R., Lady Q.,
Lady Palmerston, the Marchioness of P., Mrs W.E. Gladstone and
others, beseeching the pleasure of her company, reminding her of
ancient alliances between their family and her own, etc.]— all of
which is properly enclosed in square brackets, as above, for the
good reason that a parenthesis it was without any importance in
Orlando’s life. She skipped it, to get on with the text. For when
the bonfires were blazing in the marketplace, she was in the dark
woods with Shelmerdine alone. So fine was the weather that the
trees stretched their branches motionless above them, and if a leaf
fell, it fell, spotted red and gold, so slowly that one could watch
it for half an hour fluttering and falling till it came to rest at
last, on Orlando’s foot.</p>
<p>‘Tell me, Mar,’ she would say (and here it must be explained,
that when she called him by the first syllable of his first name,
she was in a dreamy, amorous, acquiescent mood, domestic, languid a
little, as if spiced logs were burning, and it was evening, yet not
time to dress, and a thought wet perhaps outside, enough to make
the leaves glisten, but a nightingale might be singing even so
among the azaleas, two or three dogs barking at distant farms, a
cock crowing — all of which the reader should imagine in her
voice)—’Tell me, Mar,’ she would say, ‘about Cape Horn.’ Then
Shelmerdine would make a little model on the ground of the Cape
with twigs and dead leaves and an empty snail shell or two.</p>
<p>‘Here’s the north,’ he would say. ‘There’s the south. The wind’s
coming from hereabouts. Now the brig is sailing due west; we’ve
just lowered the top-boom mizzen: and so you see — here, where this
bit of grass is, she enters the current which you’ll find marked —
where’s my map and compasses, Bo’sun? Ah! thanks, that’ll do, where
the snail shell is. The current catches her on the starboard side,
so we must rig the jib-boom or we shall be carried to the larboard,
which is where that beech leaf is — for you must understand my dear
—’ and so he would go on, and she would listen to every word;
interpreting them rightly, so as to see, that is to say, without
his having to tell her, the phosphorescence on the waves; the
icicles clanking in the shrouds; how he went to the top of the mast
in a gale; there reflected on the destiny of man; came down again;
had a whisky and soda; went on shore; was trapped by a black woman;
repented; reasoned it out; read Pascal; determined to write
philosophy; bought a monkey; debated the true end of life; decided
in favour of Cape Horn, and so on. All this and a thousand other
things she understood him to say, and so when she replied, Yes,
negresses are seductive, aren’t they? he having told her that the
supply of biscuits now gave out, he was surprised and delighted to
find how well she had taken his meaning.</p>
<p>‘Are you positive you aren’t a man?’ he would ask anxiously, and
she would echo,</p>
<p>‘Can it be possible you’re not a woman?’ and then they must put
it to the proof without more ado. For each was so surprised at the
quickness of the other’s sympathy, and it was to each such a
revelation that a woman could be as tolerant and free-spoken as a
man, and a man as strange and subtle as a woman, that they had to
put the matter to the proof at once.</p>
<p>And so they would go on talking or rather, understanding, which
has become the main art of speech in an age when words are growing
daily so scanty in comparison with ideas that ‘the biscuits ran
out’ has to stand for kissing a negress in the dark when one has
just read Bishop Berkeley’s philosophy for the tenth time. (And
from this it follows that only the most profound masters of style
can tell the truth, and when one meets a simple one-syllable
writer, one may conclude, without any doubt at all, that the poor
man is lying.)</p>
<p>So they would talk; and then, when her feet were fairly covered
with spotted autumn leaves, Orlando would rise and stroll away into
the heart of the woods in solitude, leaving Bonthrop sitting there
among the snail shells, making models of Cape Horn. ‘Bonthrop,’ she
would say, ‘I’m off,’ and when she called him by his second name,
‘Bonthrop’, it should signify to the reader that she was in a
solitary mood, felt them both as specks on a desert, was desirous
only of meeting death by herself, for people die daily, die at
dinner tables, or like this, out of doors in the autumn woods; and
with the bonfires blazing and Lady Palmerston or Lady Derby asking
her out every night to dinner, the desire for death would overcome
her, and so saying ‘Bonthrop’, she said in effect, ‘I’m dead’, and
pushed her way as a spirit might through the spectre-pale beech
trees, and so oared herself deep into solitude as if the little
flicker of noise and movement were over and she were free now to
take her way — all of which the reader should hear in her voice
when she said ‘Bonthrop,’ and should also add, the better to
illumine the word, that for him too the same word signified,
mystically, separation and isolation and the disembodied pacing the
deck of his brig in unfathomable seas.</p>
<p>After some hours of death, suddenly a jay shrieked
‘Shelmerdine’, and stooping, she picked up one of those autumn
crocuses which to some people signify that very word, and put it
with the jay’s feather that came tumbling blue through the beech
woods, in her breast. Then she called ‘Shelmerdine’ and the word
went shooting this way and that way through the woods and struck
him where he sat, making models out of snail shells in the grass.
He saw her, and heard her coming to him with the crocus and the
jay’s feather in her breast, and cried ‘Orlando’, which meant (and
it must be remembered that when bright colours like blue and yellow
mix themselves in our eyes, some of it rubs off on our thoughts)
first the bowing and swaying of bracken as if something were
breaking through; which proved to be a ship in full sail, heaving
and tossing a little dreamily, rather as if she had a whole year of
summer days to make her voyage in; and so the ship bears down,
heaving this way, heaving that way, nobly, indolently, and rides
over the crest of this wave and sinks into the hollow of that one,
and so, suddenly stands over you (who are in a little cockle shell
of a boat, looking up at her) with all her sails quivering, and
then, behold, they drop all of a heap on deck — as Orlando dropped
now into the grass beside him.</p>
<p>Eight or nine days had been spent thus, but on the tenth, which
was the 26th of October, Orlando was lying in the bracken, while
Shelmerdine recited Shelley (whose entire works he had by heart),
when a leaf which had started to fall slowly enough from a treetop
whipped briskly across Orlando’s foot. A second leaf followed and
then a third. Orlando shivered and turned pale. It was the wind.
Shelmerdine — but it would be more proper now to call him Bonthrop
— leapt to his feet.</p>
<p>‘The wind!’ he cried.</p>
<p>Together they ran through the woods, the wind plastering them
with leaves as they ran, to the great court and through it and the
little courts, frightened servants leaving their brooms and their
saucepans to follow after till they reached the Chapel, and there a
scattering of lights was lit as fast as could be, one knocking over
this bench, another snuffing out that taper. Bells were rung.
People were summoned. At length there was Mr Dupper catching at the
ends of his white tie and asking where was the prayer book. And
they thrust Queen Mary’s prayer book in his hands and he searched,
hastily fluttering the pages, and said, ‘Marmaduke Bonthrop
Shelmerdine, and Lady Orlando, kneel down’; and they knelt down,
and now they were bright and now they were dark as the light and
shadow came flying helter-skelter through the painted windows; and
among the banging of innumerable doors and a sound like brass pots
beating, the organ sounded, its growl coming loud and faint
alternately, and Mr Dupper, who was grown a very old man, tried now
to raise his voice above the uproar and could not be heard and then
all was quiet for a moment, and one word — it might be ‘the jaws of
death’— rang out clear, while all the estate servants kept pressing
in with rakes and whips still in their hands to listen, and some
sang loud and others prayed, and now a bird was dashed against the
pane, and now there was a clap of thunder, so that no one heard the
word Obey spoken or saw, except as a golden flash, the ring pass
from hand to hand. All was movement and confusion. And up they rose
with the organ booming and the lightning playing and the rain
pouring, and the Lady Orlando, with her ring on her finger, went
out into the court in her thin dress and held the swinging stirrup,
for the horse was bitted and bridled and the foam was still on his
flank, for her husband to mount, which he did with one bound, and
the horse leapt forward and Orlando, standing there, cried out
Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine! and he answered her Orlando! and
the words went dashing and circling like wild hawks together among
the belfries and higher and higher, further and further, faster and
faster they circled, till they crashed and fell in a shower of
fragments to the ground; and she went in.</p>
