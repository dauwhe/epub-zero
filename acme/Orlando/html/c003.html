<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
</div>



<p>It is, indeed, highly unfortunate, and much to be regretted that at
this stage of Orlando’s career, when he played a most important
part in the public life of his country, we have least information
to go upon. We know that he discharged his duties to admiration —
witness his Bath and his Dukedom. We know that he had a finger in
some of the most delicate negotiations between King Charles and the
Turks — to that, treaties in the vault of the Record Office bear
testimony. But the revolution which broke out during his period of
office, and the fire which followed, have so damaged or destroyed
all those papers from which any trustworthy record could be drawn,
that what we can give is lamentably incomplete. Often the paper was
scorched a deep brown in the middle of the most important sentence.
Just when we thought to elucidate a secret that has puzzled
historians for a hundred years, there was a hole in the manuscript
big enough to put your finger through. We have done our best to
piece out a meagre summary from the charred fragments that remain;
but often it has been necessary to speculate, to surmise, and even
to use the imagination.</p>
<p>Orlando’s day was passed, it would seem, somewhat in this
fashion. About seven, he would rise, wrap himself in a long Turkish
cloak, light a cheroot, and lean his elbows on the parapet. Thus he
would stand, gazing at the city beneath him, apparently entranced.
At this hour the mist would lie so thick that the domes of Santa
Sofia and the rest would seem to be afloat; gradually the mist
would uncover them; the bubbles would be seen to be firmly fixed;
there would be the river; there the Galata Bridge; there the
green-turbaned pilgrims without eyes or noses, begging alms; there
the pariah dogs picking up offal; there the shawled women; there
the innumerable donkeys; there men on horses carrying long poles.
Soon, the whole town would be astir with the cracking of whips, the
beating of gongs, cryings to prayer, lashing of mules, and rattle
of brass-bound wheels, while sour odours, made from bread
fermenting and incense, and spice, rose even to the heights of Pera
itself and seemed the very breath of the strident multi-coloured
and barbaric population.</p>
<p>Nothing, he reflected, gazing at the view which was now
sparkling in the sun, could well be less like the counties of
Surrey and Kent or the towns of London and Tunbridge Wells. To the
right and left rose in bald and stony prominence the inhospitable
Asian mountains, to which the arid castle of a robber chief or two
might hang; but parsonage there was none, nor manor house, nor
cottage, nor oak, elm, violet, ivy, or wild eglantine. There were
no hedges for ferns to grow on, and no fields for sheep to graze.
The houses were white as egg-shells and as bald. That he, who was
English root and fibre, should yet exult to the depths of his heart
in this wild panorama, and gaze and gaze at those passes and far
heights planning journeys there alone on foot where only the goat
and shepherd had gone before; should feel a passion of affection
for the bright, unseasonable flowers, love the unkempt pariah dogs
beyond even his elk hounds at home, and snuff the acrid, sharp
smell of the streets eagerly into his nostrils, surprised him. He
wondered if, in the season of the Crusades, one of his ancestors
had taken up with a Circassian peasant woman; thought it possible;
fancied a certain darkness in his complexion; and, going indoors
again, withdrew to his bath.</p>
<p>An hour later, properly scented, curled, and anointed, he would
receive visits from secretaries and other high officials carrying,
one after another, red boxes which yielded only to his own golden
key. Within were papers of the highest importance, of which only
fragments, here a flourish, there a seal firmly attached to a piece
of burnt silk, now remain. Of their contents then, we cannot speak,
but can only testify that Orlando was kept busy, what with his wax
and seals, his various coloured ribbons which had to be diversely
attached, his engrossing of titles and making of flourishes round
capital letters, till luncheon came — a splendid meal of perhaps
thirty courses.</p>
<p>After luncheon, lackeys announced that his coach and six was at
the door, and he went, preceded by purple Janissaries running on
foot and waving great ostrich feather fans above their heads, to
call upon the other ambassadors and dignitaries of state. The
ceremony was always the same. On reaching the courtyard, the
Janissaries struck with their fans upon the main portal, which
immediately flew open revealing a large chamber, splendidly
furnished. Here were seated two figures, generally of the opposite
sexes. Profound bows and curtseys were exchanged. In the first
room, it was permissible only to mention the weather. Having said
that it was fine or wet, hot or cold, the Ambassador then passed on
to the next chamber, where again, two figures rose to greet him.
Here it was only permissible to compare Constantinople as a place
of residence with London; and the Ambassador naturally said that he
preferred Constantinople, and his hosts naturally said, though they
had not seen it, that they preferred London. In the next chamber,
King Charles’s and the Sultan’s healths had to be discussed at some
length. In the next were discussed the Ambassador’s health and that
of his host’s wife, but more briefly. In the next the Ambassador
complimented his host upon his furniture, and the host complimented
the Ambassador upon his dress. In the next, sweet meats were
offered, the host deploring their badness, the Ambassador extolling
their goodness. The ceremony ended at length with the smoking of a
hookah and the drinking of a glass of coffee; but though the
motions of smoking and drinking were gone through punctiliously
there was neither tobacco in the pipe nor coffee in the glass, as,
had either smoke or drink been real, the human frame would have
sunk beneath the surfeit. For, no sooner had the Ambassador
despatched one such visit, than another had to be undertaken. The
same ceremonies were gone through in precisely the same order six
or seven times over at the houses of the other great officials, so
that it was often late at night before the Ambassador reached home.
Though Orlando performed these tasks to admiration and never denied
that they are, perhaps, the most important part of a diplomatist’s
duties, he was undoubtedly fatigued by them, and often depressed to
such a pitch of gloom that he preferred to take his dinner alone
with his dogs. To them, indeed, he might be heard talking in his
own tongue. And sometimes, it is said, he would pass out of his own
gates late at night so disguised that the sentries did not know
him. Then he would mingle with the crowd on the Galata Bridge; or
stroll through the bazaars; or throw aside his shoes and join the
worshippers in the Mosques. Once, when it was given out that he was
ill of a fever, shepherds, bringing their goats to market, reported
that they had met an English Lord on the mountain top and heard him
praying to his God. This was thought to be Orlando himself, and his
prayer was, no doubt, a poem said aloud, for it was known that he
still carried about with him, in the bosom of his cloak, a much
scored manuscript; and servants, listening at the door, heard the
Ambassador chanting something in an odd, sing-song voice when he
was alone.</p>
<p>It is with fragments such as these that we must do our best to
make up a picture of Orlando’s life and character at this time.
There exist, even to this day, rumours, legends, anecdotes of a
floating and unauthenticated kind about Orlando’s life in
Constantinople —(we have quoted but a few of them) which go to
prove that he possessed, now that he was in the prime of life, the
power to stir the fancy and rivet the eye which will keep a memory
green long after all that more durable qualities can do to preserve
it is forgotten. The power is a mysterious one compounded of
beauty, birth, and some rarer gift, which we may call glamour and
have done with it. ‘A million candles’, as Sasha had said, burnt in
him without his being at the trouble of lighting a single one. He
moved like a stag, without any need to think about his legs. He
spoke in his ordinary voice and echo beat a silver gong. Hence
rumours gathered round him. He became the adored of many women and
some men. It was not necessary that they should speak to him or
even that they should see him; they conjured up before them
especially when the scenery was romantic, or the sun was setting,
the figure of a noble gentleman in silk stockings. Upon the poor
and uneducated, he had the same power as upon the rich. Shepherds,
gipsies, donkey drivers, still sing songs about the English Lord
‘who dropped his emeralds in the well’, which undoubtedly refer to
Orlando, who once, it seems, tore his jewels from him in a moment
of rage or intoxication and flung them in a fountain; whence they
were fished by a page boy. But this romantic power, it is well
known, is often associated with a nature of extreme reserve.
Orlando seems to have made no friends. As far as is known, he
formed no attachments. A certain great lady came all the way from
England in order to be near him, and pestered him with her
attentions, but he continued to discharge his duties so
indefatigably that he had not been Ambassador at the Horn for more
than two years and a half before King Charles signified his
intention of raising him to the highest rank in the peerage. The
envious said that this was Nell Gwyn’s tribute to the memory of a
leg. But, as she had seen him once only, and was then busily
engaged in pelting her royal master with nutshells, it is likely
that it was his merits that won him his Dukedom, not his
calves.</p>
<p>Here we must pause, for we have reached a moment of great
significance in his career. For the conferring of the Dukedom was
the occasion of a very famous, and indeed, much disputed incident,
which we must now describe, picking our way among burnt papers and
little bits of tape as best we may. It was at the end of the great
fast of Ramadan that the Order of the Bath and the patent of
nobility arrived in a frigate commanded by Sir Adrian Scrope; and
Orlando made this the occasion for an entertainment more splendid
than any that has been known before or since in Constantinople. The
night was fine; the crowd immense, and the windows of the Embassy
brilliantly illuminated. Again, details are lacking, for the fire
had its way with all such records, and has left only tantalizing
fragments which leave the most important points obscure. From the
diary of John Fenner Brigge, however, an English naval officer, who
was among the guests, we gather that people of all nationalities
‘were packed like herrings in a barrel’ in the courtyard. The crowd
pressed so unpleasantly close that Brigge soon climbed into a Judas
tree, the better to observe the proceedings. The rumour had got
about among the natives (and here is additional proof of Orlando’s
mysterious power over the imagination) that some kind of miracle
was to be performed. ‘Thus,’ writes Brigge (but his manuscript is
full of burns and holes, some sentences being quite illegible),
‘when the rockets began to soar into the air, there was
considerable uneasiness among us lest the native population should
be seized… fraught with unpleasant consequences to all… English
ladies in the company, I own that my hand went to my cutlass.
Happily,’ he continues in his somewhat long-winded style, ‘these
fears seemed, for the moment, groundless and, observing the
demeanour of the natives… I came to the conclusion that this
demonstration of our skill in the art of pyrotechny was valuable,
if only because it impressed upon them… the superiority of the
British… Indeed, the sight was one of indescribable magnificence. I
found myself alternately praising the Lord that he had permitted…
and wishing that my poor, dear mother… By the Ambassador’s orders,
the long windows, which are so imposing a feature of Eastern
architecture, for though ignorant in many ways… were thrown wide;
and within, we could see a tableau vivant or theatrical display in
which English ladies and gentlemen… represented a masque the work
of one… The words were inaudible, but the sight of so many of our
countrymen and women, dressed with the highest elegance and
distinction… moved me to emotions of which I am certainly not
ashamed, though unable… I was intent upon observing the astonishing
conduct of Lady — which was of a nature to fasten the eyes of all
upon her, and to bring discredit upon her sex and country, when’—
unfortunately a branch of the Judas tree broke, Lieutenant Brigge
fell to the ground, and the rest of the entry records only his
gratitude to Providence (who plays a very large part in the diary)
and the exact nature of his injuries.</p>
<p>Happily, Miss Penelope Hartopp, daughter of the General of that
name, saw the scene from inside and carries on the tale in a
letter, much defaced too, which ultimately reached a female friend
at Tunbridge Wells. Miss Penelope was no less lavish in her
enthusiasm than the gallant officer. ‘Ravishing,’ she exclaims ten
times on one page, ‘wondrous… utterly beyond description… gold
plate… candelabras… negroes in plush breeches… pyramids of ice…
fountains of negus… jellies made to represent His Majesty’s ships…
swans made to represent water lilies… birds in golden cages…
gentlemen in slashed crimson velvet… Ladies’ headdresses AT LEAST
six foot high… musical boxes… .Mr Peregrine said I looked QUITE
lovely which I only repeat to you, my dearest, because I know… Oh!
how I longed for you all!… surpassing anything we have seen at the
Pantiles… oceans to drink… some gentlemen overcome… Lady Betty
ravishing… .Poor Lady Bonham made the unfortunate mistake of
sitting down without a chair beneath her… Gentlemen all very
gallant… wished a thousand times for you and dearest Betsy… But the
sight of all others, the cynosure of all eyes… as all admitted, for
none could be so vile as to deny it, was the Ambassador himself.
Such a leg! Such a countenance!! Such princely manners!!! To see
him come into the room! To see him go out again! And something
INTERESTING in the expression, which makes one feel, one scarcely
knows why, that he has SUFFERED! They say a lady was the cause of
it. The heartless monster!!! How can one of our REPUTED TENDER SEX
have had the effrontery!!! He is unmarried, and half the ladies in
the place are wild for love of him… A thousand, thousand kisses to
Tom, Gerry, Peter, and dearest Mew’ [presumably her cat].</p>
<p>From the Gazette of the time, we gather that ‘as the clock
struck twelve, the Ambassador appeared on the centre Balcony which
was hung with priceless rugs. Six Turks of the Imperial Body Guard,
each over six foot in height, held torches to his right and left.
Rockets rose into the air at his appearance, and a great shout went
up from the people, which the Ambassador acknowledged, bowing
deeply, and speaking a few words of thanks in the Turkish language,
which it was one of his accomplishments to speak with fluency.
Next, Sir Adrian Scrope, in the full dress of a British Admiral,
advanced; the Ambassador knelt on one knee; the Admiral placed the
Collar of the Most Noble Order of the Bath round his neck, then
pinned the Star to his breast; after which another gentleman of the
diplomatic corps advancing in a stately manner placed on his
shoulders the ducal robes, and handed him on a crimson cushion, the
ducal coronet.’</p>
<p>At length, with a gesture of extraordinary majesty and grace,
first bowing profoundly, then raising himself proudly erect,
Orlando took the golden circlet of strawberry leaves and placed it,
with a gesture which none that saw it ever forgot, upon his brows.
It was at this point that the first disturbance began. Either the
people had expected a miracle — some say a shower of gold was
prophesied to fall from the skies — which did not happen, or this
was the signal chosen for the attack to begin; nobody seems to
know; but as the coronet settled on Orlando’s brows a great uproar
rose. Bells began ringing; the harsh cries of the prophets were
heard above the shouts of the people; many Turks fell flat to the
ground and touched the earth with their foreheads. A door burst
open. The natives pressed into the banqueting rooms. Women
shrieked. A certain lady, who was said to be dying for love of
Orlando, seized a candelabra and dashed it to the ground. What
might not have happened, had it not been for the presence of Sir
Adrian Scrope and a squad of British bluejackets, nobody can say.
But the Admiral ordered the bugles to be sounded; a hundred
bluejackets stood instantly at attention; the disorder was quelled,
and quiet, at least for the time being, fell upon the scene.</p>
<p>So far, we are on the firm, if rather narrow, ground of
ascertained truth. But nobody has ever known exactly what took
place later that night. The testimony of the sentries and others
seems, however, to prove that the Embassy was empty of company, and
shut up for the night in the usual way by two A.M. The Ambassador
was seen to go to his room, still wearing the insignia of his rank,
and shut the door. Some say he locked it, which was against his
custom. Others maintain that they heard music of a rustic kind,
such as shepherds play, later that night in the courtyard under the
Ambassador’s window. A washer-woman, who was kept awake by
toothache, said that she saw a man’s figure, wrapped in a cloak or
dressing gown, come out upon the balcony. Then, she said, a woman,
much muffled, but apparently of the peasant class, was drawn up by
means of a rope which the man let down to her on to the balcony.
There, the washer-woman said, they embraced passionately ‘like
lovers’, and went into the room together, drawing the curtains so
that no more could be seen.</p>
<p>Next morning, the Duke, as we must now call him, was found by
his secretaries sunk in profound slumber amid bed clothes that were
much tumbled. The room was in some disorder, his coronet having
rolled on the floor, and his cloak and garter being flung all of a
heap on a chair. The table was littered with papers. No suspicion
was felt at first, as the fatigues of the night had been great. But
when afternoon came and he still slept, a doctor was summoned. He
applied remedies which had been used on the previous occasion,
plasters, nettles, emetics, etc., but without success. Orlando
slept on. His secretaries then thought it their duty to examine the
papers on the table. Many were scribbled over with poetry, in which
frequent mention was made of an oak tree. There were also various
state papers and others of a private nature concerning the
management of his estates in England. But at length they came upon
a document of far greater significance. It was nothing less,
indeed, than a deed of marriage, drawn up, signed, and witnessed
between his Lordship, Orlando, Knight of the Garter, etc., etc.,
etc., and Rosina Pepita, a dancer, father unknown, but reputed a
gipsy, mother also unknown but reputed a seller of old iron in the
market-place over against the Galata Bridge. The secretaries looked
at each other in dismay. And still Orlando slept. Morning and
evening they watched him, but, save that his breathing was regular
and his cheeks still flushed their habitual deep rose, he gave no
sign of life. Whatever science or ingenuity could do to waken him
they did. But still he slept.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of his trance (Thursday, May the 10th) the
first shot was fired of that terrible and bloody insurrection of
which Lieutenant Brigge had detected the first symptoms. The Turks
rose against the Sultan, set fire to the town, and put every
foreigner they could find, either to the sword or to the bastinado.
A few English managed to escape; but, as might have been expected,
the gentlemen of the British Embassy preferred to die in defence of
their red boxes, or, in extreme cases, to swallow bunches of keys
rather than let them fall into the hands of the Infidel. The
rioters broke into Orlando’s room, but seeing him stretched to all
appearances dead they left him untouched, and only robbed him of
his coronet and the robes of the Garter.</p>
<p>And now again obscurity descends, and would indeed that it were
deeper! Would, we almost have it in our hearts to exclaim, that it
were so deep that we could see nothing whatever through its
opacity! Would that we might here take the pen and write Finis to
our work! Would that we might spare the reader what is to come and
say to him in so many words, Orlando died and was buried. But here,
alas, Truth, Candour, and Honesty, the austere Gods who keep watch
and ward by the inkpot of the biographer, cry No! Putting their
silver trumpets to their lips they demand in one blast, Truth! And
again they cry Truth! and sounding yet a third time in concert they
peal forth, The Truth and nothing but the Truth!</p>
<p>At which — Heaven be praised! for it affords us a breathing
space — the doors gently open, as if a breath of the gentlest and
holiest zephyr had wafted them apart, and three figures enter.
First, comes our Lady of Purity; whose brows are bound with fillets
of the whitest lamb’s wool; whose hair is as an avalanche of the
driven snow; and in whose hand reposes the white quill of a virgin
goose. Following her, but with a statelier step, comes our Lady of
Chastity; on whose brow is set like a turret of burning but
unwasting fire a diadem of icicles; her eyes are pure stars, and
her fingers, if they touch you, freeze you to the bone. Close
behind her, sheltering indeed in the shadow of her more stately
sisters, comes our Lady of Modesty, frailest and fairest of the
three; whose face is only shown as the young moon shows when it is
thin and sickle shaped and half hidden among clouds. Each advances
towards the centre of the room where Orlando still lies sleeping;
and with gestures at once appealing and commanding, OUR LADY OF
PURITY speaks first:</p>
<p>‘I am the guardian of the sleeping fawn; the snow is dear to me;
and the moon rising; and the silver sea. With my robes I cover the
speckled hen’s eggs and the brindled sea shell; I cover vice and
poverty. On all things frail or dark or doubtful, my veil descends.
Wherefore, speak not, reveal not. Spare, O spare!’</p>
<p>Here the trumpets peal forth.</p>
<p>‘Purity Avaunt! Begone Purity!’</p>
<p>Then OUR LADY OF CHASTITY speaks:</p>
<p>‘I am she whose touch freezes and whose glance turns to stone. I
have stayed the star in its dancing, and the wave as it falls. The
highest Alps are my dwelling place; and when I walk, the lightnings
flash in my hair; where my eyes fall, they kill. Rather than let
Orlando wake, I will freeze him to the bone. Spare, O spare!’</p>
<p>Here the trumpets peal forth.</p>
<p>‘Chastity Avaunt! Begone Chastity!’</p>
<p>Then OUR LADY OF MODESTY speaks, so low that one can hardly
hear:</p>
<p>‘I am she that men call Modesty. Virgin I am and ever shall be.
Not for me the fruitful fields and the fertile vineyard. Increase
is odious to me; and when the apples burgeon or the flocks breed, I
run, I run; I let my mantle fall. My hair covers my eyes. I do not
see. Spare, O spare!’</p>
<p>Again the trumpets peal forth:</p>
<p>‘Modesty Avaunt! Begone Modesty!’</p>
<p>With gestures of grief and lamentation the three sisters now
join hands and dance slowly, tossing their veils and singing as
they go:</p>
<p>‘Truth come not out from your horrid den. Hide deeper, fearful
Truth. For you flaunt in the brutal gaze of the sun things that
were better unknown and undone; you unveil the shameful; the dark
you make clear, Hide! Hide! Hide!’</p>
<p>Here they make as if to cover Orlando with their draperies. The
trumpets, meanwhile, still blare forth,</p>
<p>‘The Truth and nothing but the Truth.’</p>
<p>At this the Sisters try to cast their veils over the mouths of
the trumpets so as to muffle them, but in vain, for now all the
trumpets blare forth together,</p>
<p>‘Horrid Sisters, go!’</p>
<p>The sisters become distracted and wail in unison, still circling
and flinging their veils up and down.</p>
<p>‘It has not always been so! But men want us no longer; the women
detest us. We go; we go. I (PURITY SAYS THIS) to the hen roost. I
(CHASTITY SAYS THIS) to the still unravished heights of Surrey. I
(MODESTY SAYS THIS) to any cosy nook where there are ivy and
curtains in plenty.’</p>
<p>‘For there, not here (all speak together joining hands and
making gestures of farewell and despair towards the bed where
Orlando lies sleeping) dwell still in nest and boudoir, office and
lawcourt those who love us; those who honour us, virgins and city
men; lawyers and doctors; those who prohibit; those who deny; those
who reverence without knowing why; those who praise without
understanding; the still very numerous (Heaven be praised) tribe of
the respectable; who prefer to see not; desire to know not; love
the darkness; those still worship us, and with reason; for we have
given them Wealth, Prosperity, Comfort, Ease. To them we go, you we
leave. Come, Sisters, come! This is no place for us here.’</p>
<p>They retire in haste, waving their draperies over their heads,
as if to shut out something that they dare not look upon and close
the door behind them.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, now left entirely alone in the room with the
sleeping Orlando and the trumpeters. The trumpeters, ranging
themselves side by side in order, blow one terrific blast:—</p>
<div class="center">
<p>‘THE TRUTH!</p>
</div>
<p>at which Orlando woke.</p>
<p>He stretched himself. He rose. He stood upright in complete
nakedness before us, and while the trumpets pealed Truth! Truth!
Truth! we have no choice left but confess — he was a woman.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p>The sound of the trumpets died away and Orlando stood stark
naked. No human being, since the world began, has ever looked more
ravishing. His form combined in one the strength of a man and a
woman’s grace. As he stood there, the silver trumpets prolonged
their note, as if reluctant to leave the lovely sight which their
blast had called forth; and Chastity, Purity, and Modesty,
inspired, no doubt, by Curiosity, peeped in at the door and threw a
garment like a towel at the naked form which, unfortunately, fell
short by several inches. Orlando looked himself up and down in a
long looking-glass, without showing any signs of discomposure, and
went, presumably, to his bath.</p>
<p>We may take advantage of this pause in the narrative to make
certain statements. Orlando had become a woman — there is no
denying it. But in every other respect, Orlando remained precisely
as he had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future,
did nothing whatever to alter their identity. Their faces remained,
as their portraits prove, practically the same. His memory — but in
future we must, for convention’s sake, say ‘her’ for ‘his,’ and
‘she’ for ‘he’— her memory then, went back through all the events
of her past life without encountering any obstacle. Some slight
haziness there may have been, as if a few dark drops had fallen
into the clear pool of memory; certain things had become a little
dimmed; but that was all. The change seemed to have been
accomplished painlessly and completely and in such a way that
Orlando herself showed no surprise at it. Many people, taking this
into account, and holding that such a change of sex is against
nature, have been at great pains to prove (1) that Orlando had
always been a woman, (2) that Orlando is at this moment a man. Let
biologists and psychologists determine. It is enough for us to
state the simple fact; Orlando was a man till the age of thirty;
when he became a woman and has remained so ever since.</p>
<p>But let other pens treat of sex and sexuality; we quit such
odious subjects as soon as we can. Orlando had now washed, and
dressed herself in those Turkish coats and trousers which can be
worn indifferently by either sex; and was forced to consider her
position. That it was precarious and embarrassing in the extreme
must be the first thought of every reader who has followed her
story with sympathy. Young, noble, beautiful, she had woken to find
herself in a position than which we can conceive none more delicate
for a young lady of rank. We should not have blamed her had she
rung the bell, screamed, or fainted. But Orlando showed no such
signs of perturbation. All her actions were deliberate in the
extreme, and might indeed have been thought to show tokens of
premeditation. First, she carefully examined the papers on the
table; took such as seemed to be written in poetry, and secreted
them in her bosom; next she called her Seleuchi hound, which had
never left her bed all these days, though half famished with
hunger, fed and combed him; then stuck a pair of pistols in her
belt; finally wound about her person several strings of emeralds
and pearls of the finest orient which had formed part of her
Ambassadorial wardrobe. This done, she leant out of the window,
gave one low whistle, and descended the shattered and bloodstained
staircase, now strewn with the litter of waste-paper baskets,
treaties, despatches, seals, sealing wax, etc., and so entered the
courtyard. There, in the shadow of a giant fig tree, waited an old
gipsy on a donkey. He led another by the bridle. Orlando swung her
leg over it; and thus, attended by a lean dog, riding a donkey, in
company of a gipsy, the Ambassador of Great Britain at the Court of
the Sultan left Constantinople.</p>
<p>They rode for several days and nights and met with a variety of
adventures, some at the hands of men, some at the hands of nature,
in all of which Orlando acquitted herself with courage. Within a
week they reached the high ground outside Broussa, which was then
the chief camping ground of the gipsy tribe to which Orlando had
allied herself. Often she had looked at those mountains from her
balcony at the Embassy; often had longed to be there; and to find
oneself where one has longed to be always, to a reflective mind,
gives food for thought. For some time, however, she was too well
pleased with the change to spoil it by thinking. The pleasure of
having no documents to seal or sign, no flourishes to make, no
calls to pay, was enough. The gipsies followed the grass; when it
was grazed down, on they moved again. She washed in streams if she
washed at all; no boxes, red, blue, or green, were presented to
her; there was not a key, let alone a golden key, in the whole
camp; as for ‘visiting’, the word was unknown. She milked the
goats; she collected brushwood; she stole a hen’s egg now and then,
but always put a coin or a pearl in place of it; she herded cattle;
she stripped vines; she trod the grape; she filled the goat-skin
and drank from it; and when she remembered how, at about this time
of day, she should have been making the motions of drinking and
smoking over an empty coffee-cup and a pipe which lacked tobacco,
she laughed aloud, cut herself another hunch of bread, and begged
for a puff from old Rustum’s pipe, filled though it was with cow
dung.</p>
<p>The gipsies, with whom it is obvious that she must have been in
secret communication before the revolution, seem to have looked
upon her as one of themselves (which is always the highest
compliment a people can pay), and her dark hair and dark complexion
bore out the belief that she was, by birth, one of them and had
been snatched by an English Duke from a nut tree when she was a
baby and taken to that barbarous land where people live in houses
because they are too feeble and diseased to stand the open air.
Thus, though in many ways inferior to them, they were willing to
help her to become more like them; taught her their arts of
cheese-making and basket-weaving, their science of stealing and
bird-snaring, and were even prepared to consider letting her marry
among them.</p>
<p>But Orlando had contracted in England some of the customs or
diseases (whatever you choose to consider them) which cannot, it
seems, be expelled. One evening, when they were all sitting round
the camp fire and the sunset was blazing over the Thessalian hills,
Orlando exclaimed:</p>
<p>‘How good to eat!’</p>
<p>(The gipsies have no word for ‘beautiful’. This is the
nearest.)</p>
<p>All the young men and women burst out laughing uproariously. The
sky good to eat, indeed! The elders, however, who had seen more of
foreigners than they had, became suspicious. They noticed that
Orlando often sat for whole hours doing nothing whatever, except
look here and then there; they would come upon her on some hill-top
staring straight in front of her, no matter whether the goats were
grazing or straying. They began to suspect that she had other
beliefs than their own, and the older men and women thought it
probable that she had fallen into the clutches of the vilest and
cruellest among all the Gods, which is Nature. Nor were they far
wrong. The English disease, a love of Nature, was inborn in her,
and here, where Nature was so much larger and more powerful than in
England, she fell into its hands as she had never done before. The
malady is too well known, and has been, alas, too often described
to need describing afresh, save very briefly. There were mountains;
there were valleys; there were streams. She climbed the mountains;
roamed the valleys; sat on the banks of the streams. She likened
the hills to ramparts, to the breasts of doves, and the flanks of
kine. She compared the flowers to enamel and the turf to Turkey
rugs worn thin. Trees were withered hags, and sheep were grey
boulders. Everything, in fact, was something else. She found the
tarn on the mountain-top and almost threw herself in to seek the
wisdom she thought lay hid there; and when, from the mountain-top,
she beheld far off, across the Sea of Marmara, the plains of
Greece, and made out (her eyes were admirable) the Acropolis with a
white streak or two, which must, she thought, be the Parthenon, her
soul expanded with her eyeballs, and she prayed that she might
share the majesty of the hills, know the serenity of the plains,
etc. etc., as all such believers do. Then, looking down, the red
hyacinth, the purple iris wrought her to cry out in ecstasy at the
goodness, the beauty of nature; raising her eyes again, she beheld
the eagle soaring, and imagined its raptures and made them her own.
Returning home, she saluted each star, each peak, and each
watch-fire as if they signalled to her alone; and at last, when she
flung herself upon her mat in the gipsies’ tent, she could not help
bursting out again, How good to eat! How good to eat! (For it is a
curious fact that though human beings have such imperfect means of
communication, that they can only say ‘good to eat’ when they mean
‘beautiful’ and the other way about, they will yet endure ridicule
and misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to
themselves.) All the young gipsies laughed. But Rustum el Sadi, the
old man who had brought Orlando out of Constantinople on his
donkey, sat silent. He had a nose like a scimitar; his cheeks were
furrowed as if from the age-long descent of iron hail; he was brown
and keen-eyed, and as he sat tugging at his hookah he observed
Orlando narrowly. He had the deepest suspicion that her God was
Nature. One day he found her in tears. Interpreting this to mean
that her God had punished her, he told her that he was not
surprised. He showed her the fingers of his left hand, withered by
the frost; he showed her his right foot, crushed where a rock had
fallen. This, he said, was what her God did to men. When she said,
‘But so beautiful’, using the English word, he shook his head; and
when she repeated it he was angry. He saw that she did not believe
what he believed, and that was enough, wise and ancient as he was,
to enrage him.</p>
<p>This difference of opinion disturbed Orlando, who had been
perfectly happy until now. She began to think, was Nature beautiful
or cruel; and then she asked herself what this beauty was; whether
it was in things themselves, or only in herself; so she went on to
the nature of reality, which led her to truth, which in its turn
led to Love, Friendship, Poetry (as in the days on the high mound
at home); which meditations, since she could impart no word of
them, made her long, as she had never longed before, for pen and
ink.</p>
<p>‘Oh! if only I could write!’ she cried (for she had the odd
conceit of those who write that words written are shared). She had
no ink; and but little paper. But she made ink from berries and
wine; and finding a few margins and blank spaces in the manuscript
of ‘The Oak Tree’, managed by writing a kind of shorthand, to
describe the scenery in a long, blank version poem, and to carry on
a dialogue with herself about this Beauty and Truth concisely
enough. This kept her extremely happy for hours on end. But the
gipsies became suspicious. First, they noticed that she was less
adept than before at milking and cheese-making; next, she often
hesitated before replying; and once a gipsy boy who had been
asleep, woke in a terror feeling her eyes upon him. Sometimes this
constraint would be felt by the whole tribe, numbering some dozens
of grown men and women. It sprang from the sense they had (and
their senses are very sharp and much in advance of their
vocabulary) that whatever they were doing crumbled like ashes in
their hands. An old woman making a basket, a boy skinning a sheep,
would be singing or crooning contentedly at their work, when
Orlando would come into the camp, fling herself down by the fire
and gaze into the flames. She need not even look at them, and yet
they felt, here is someone who doubts; (we make a rough-and-ready
translation from the gipsy language) here is someone who does not
do the thing for the sake of doing; nor looks for looking’s sake;
here is someone who believes neither in sheep-skin nor basket; but
sees (here they looked apprehensively about the tent) something
else. Then a vague but most unpleasant feeling would begin to work
in the boy and in the old woman. They broke their withys; they cut
their fingers. A great rage filled them. They wished Orlando would
leave the tent and never come near them again. Yet she was of a
cheerful and willing disposition, they owned; and one of her pearls
was enough to buy the finest herd of goats in Broussa.</p>
<p>Slowly, she began to feel that there was some difference between
her and the gipsies which made her hesitate sometimes to marry and
settle down among them for ever. At first she tried to account for
it by saying that she came of an ancient and civilized race,
whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people, not much better than
savages. One night when they were questioning her about England she
could not help with some pride describing the house where she was
born, how it had 365 bedrooms and had been in the possession of her
family for four or five hundred years. Her ancestors were earls, or
even dukes, she added. At this she noticed again that the gipsies
were uneasy; but not angry as before when she had praised the
beauty of nature. Now they were courteous, but concerned as people
of fine breeding are when a stranger has been made to reveal his
low birth or poverty. Rustum followed her out of the tent alone and
said that she need not mind if her father were a Duke, and
possessed all the bedrooms and furniture that she described. They
would none of them think the worse of her for that. Then she was
seized with a shame that she had never felt before. It was clear
that Rustum and the other gipsies thought a descent of four or five
hundred years only the meanest possible. Their own families went
back at least two or three thousand years. To the gipsy whose
ancestors had built the Pyramids centuries before Christ was born,
the genealogy of Howards and Plantagenets was no better and no
worse than that of the Smiths and the Joneses: both were
negligible. Moreover, where the shepherd boy had a lineage of such
antiquity, there was nothing specially memorable or desirable in
ancient birth; vagabonds and beggars all shared it. And then,
though he was too courteous to speak openly, it was clear that the
gipsy thought that there was no more vulgar ambition than to
possess bedrooms by the hundred (they were on top of a hill as they
spoke; it was night; the mountains rose around them) when the whole
earth is ours. Looked at from the gipsy point of view, a Duke,
Orlando understood, was nothing but a profiteer or robber who
snatched land and money from people who rated these things of
little worth, and could think of nothing better to do than to build
three hundred and sixty-five bedrooms when one was enough, and none
was even better than one. She could not deny that her ancestors had
accumulated field after field; house after house; honour after
honour; yet had none of them been saints or heroes, or great
benefactors of the human race. Nor could she counter the argument
(Rustum was too much of a gentleman to press it, but she
understood) that any man who did now what her ancestors had done
three or four hundred years ago would be denounced — and by her own
family most loudly — for a vulgar upstart, an adventurer, a nouveau
riche.</p>
<p>She sought to answer such arguments by the familiar if oblique
method of finding the gipsy life itself rude and barbarous; and so,
in a short time, much bad blood was bred between them. Indeed, such
differences of opinion are enough to cause bloodshed and
revolution. Towns have been sacked for less, and a million martyrs
have suffered at the stake rather than yield an inch upon any of
the points here debated. No passion is stronger in the breast of
man than the desire to make others believe as he believes. Nothing
so cuts at the root of his happiness and fills him with rage as the
sense that another rates low what he prizes high. Whigs and Tories,
Liberal party and Labour party — for what do they battle except
their own prestige? It is not love of truth but desire to prevail
that sets quarter against quarter and makes parish desire the
downfall of parish. Each seeks peace of mind and subserviency
rather than the triumph of truth and the exaltation of virtue — but
these moralities belong, and should be left to the historian, since
they are as dull as ditch water.</p>
<p>‘Four hundred and seventy-six bedrooms mean nothing to them,’
sighed Orlando.</p>
<p>‘She prefers a sunset to a flock of goats,’ said the
gipsies.</p>
<p>What was to be done, Orlando could not think. To leave the
gipsies and become once more an Ambassador seemed to her
intolerable. But it was equally impossible to remain for ever where
there was neither ink nor writing paper, neither reverence for the
Talbots nor respect for a multiplicity of bedrooms. So she was
thinking, one fine morning on the slopes of Mount Athos, when
minding her goats. And then Nature, in whom she trusted, either
played her a trick or worked a miracle — again, opinions differ too
much for it to be possible to say which. Orlando was gazing rather
disconsolately at the steep hill-side in front of her. It was now
midsummer, and if we must compare the landscape to anything, it
would have been to a dry bone; to a sheep’s skeleton; to a gigantic
skull picked white by a thousand vultures. The heat was intense,
and the little fig tree under which Orlando lay only served to
print patterns of fig-leaves upon her light burnous.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shadow, though there was nothing to cast a shadow,
appeared on the bald mountain-side opposite. It deepened quickly
and soon a green hollow showed where there had been barren rock
before. As she looked, the hollow deepened and widened, and a great
park-like space opened in the flank of the hill. Within, she could
see an undulating and grassy lawn; she could see oak trees dotted
here and there; she could see the thrushes hopping among the
branches. She could see the deer stepping delicately from shade to
shade, and could even hear the hum of insects and the gentle sighs
and shivers of a summer’s day in England. After she had gazed
entranced for some time, snow began falling; soon the whole
landscape was covered and marked with violet shades instead of
yellow sunlight. Now she saw heavy carts coming along the roads,
laden with tree trunks, which they were taking, she knew, to be
sawn for firewood; and then appeared the roofs and belfries and
towers and courtyards of her own home. The snow was falling
steadily, and she could now hear the slither and flop which it made
as it slid down the roof and fell to the ground. The smoke went up
from a thousand chimneys. All was so clear and minute that she
could see a Daw pecking for worms in the snow. Then, gradually, the
violet shadows deepened and closed over the carts and the lawns and
the great house itself. All was swallowed up. Now there was nothing
left of the grassy hollow, and instead of the green lawns was only
the blazing hill-side which a thousand vultures seemed to have
picked bare. At this, she burst into a passion of tears, and
striding back to the gipsies’ camp, told them that she must sail
for England the very next day.</p>
<p>It was happy for her that she did so. Already the young men had
plotted her death. Honour, they said, demanded it, for she did not
think as they did. Yet they would have been sorry to cut her
throat; and welcomed the news of her departure. An English merchant
ship, as luck would have it, was already under sail in the harbour
about to return to England; and Orlando, by breaking off another
pearl from her necklace, not only paid her passage but had some
banknotes left over in her wallet. These she would have liked to
present to the gipsies. But they despised wealth she knew; and she
had to content herself with embraces, which on her part were
sincere.</p>
