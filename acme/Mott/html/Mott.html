<h1>Discourse On Woman</h1>

<p> There is nothing of greater importance to the well-being of society at large  of man as well as woman than the true 
and proper position of woman. Much has been said, from time to time, upon this 
subject. It has been a theme for ridicule, for satire and sarcasm. We might look 
for this from the ignorant and vulgar; but from the intelligent and refined we 
have a right to expect that such weapons shall not be resorted to, that gross 
comparisons and vulgar epithets shall not be applied, so as to place woman, in 
a point of view, ridiculous to say the least. </p>
<p>This subject has claimed my earnest interest 
for many years. I have long wished to see woman occupying a more elevated position 
than that which custom for ages has allotted to her. It was with great regret, 
therefore, that I listened a few days ago to a lecture upon this subject, which, 
though replete with intellectual beauty, and containing much that was true and 
excellent, was yet fraught with sentiments calculated to retard the progress of 
woman to the high elevation destined by her Creator. I regretted the more that 
these sentiments should be presented with such intellectual vigor and beauty, 
because they would be likely to ensnare the young. </p>
<p>The minds of young people generally, are open 
to the reception of more exalted views upon this subject. The kind of homage that 
has been paid to woman, the flattering appeals which have too long satisfied her appeals 
to her mere fancy and imagination, are giving place to a more extended recognition 
of her rights, her important duties and responsibilities in life. Woman is claiming 
for herself stronger and more profitable food. Various are the indications leading 
to this conclusion. The increasing attention to female education, the improvement 
in the literature of the age, especially in what is called the “Ladies’ Department,” in the periodicals of the day, are among the proofs of a higher estimate of woman 
in society at large. Therefore we may hope that the intellectual and intelligent 
are being prepared for the discussion of this question, in a manner which shall 
tend to ennoble woman and dignify man. </p>
<p>Free discussion upon this, as upon all other 
subjects, is never to be feared; nor will be, except by such as prefer darkness 
to light. “Those only who are in the wrong dread discussion. The light alarms 
those only who feel the need of darkness.” It was sound philosophy, uttered 
by Jesus, “He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be 
made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” </p>
<p>I have not come here with a view of answering 
any particular parts of the lecture alluded to, in order to point out the fallacy 
of its reasoning. The speaker, however, did not profess to offer anything like 
argument on that occasion, but rather a sentiment. I have no prepared address 
to deliver to you, being unaccustomed to speak in that way; but I felt a wish 
to offer some views for your consideration, though in a desultory manner, which 
may lead to such reflection and discussion as will present the subject in a true 
light. </p>

<p>In the beginning, man and woman were created 
equal. “Male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their 
name Adam.” He gave dominion to both over the lower animals, but not to one 
over the other. </p>
<p>"Man o’er woman </p>
<p>He made not lord, such title to himself </p>
<p>Reserving, human left from human free.” </p>
<p>The cause of the subjection of woman to man, 
was early ascribed to disobedience to the command of God. This would seem to show 
that she was then regarded as not occupying her true and rightful position in 
society. </p>
<p>The laws given on Mount Sinai for the government 
of man and woman were equal, the precepts of Jesus make no distinction. Those 
who read the Scriptures, and judge for themselves, not resting satisfied with 
the perverted application of the text, do not find the distinction, that theology 
and ecclesiastical authorities have made, in the condition of the sexes. In the 
early ages, Miriam and Deborah, conjointly with Aaron and Barak, enlisted themselves 
on the side which they regarded the right, unitedly going up to their battles, 
and singing their songs of victory. We regard these with veneration. Deborah judged 
Israel many years she went up with Barak against their enemies, with an army 
of 10,000, assuring him that the honor of the battle should not be to him, but 
to a woman. Revolting as were the circumstances of their success, the acts of 
a semi-barbarous people, yet we read with reverence the song of Deborah: “Blessed 
above woman shall Jael, the wife of Heeber, the Kenite be; blessed shall she be 
above women in the tent… She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand 
to the workman’s hammer; she smote Sisera through his temples. At her feet he 
bowed, he fell, he lay down dead.” This circumstance, revolting to Christianity, 
is recognized as an act befitting woman in that day. Deborah, Huldah, and other 
honorable women, were looked up to and consulted in times of exigency, and their 
counsel was received. In that eastern country, with all the customs tending to 
degrade woman, some were called to fill great and important stations in society. 
There were also false prophetesses as well as true. The denunciations of Ezekiel 
were upon those women who would “prophesy out of their own heart, and sew 
pillows to all armholes,” c. </p>
<p>Coming down to later times, we find Anna, a 
prophetess of four-score years, in the temple day and night, speaking of Christ 
to all them who looked for redemption in Jerusalem. Numbers of women were the 
companions of Jesus,  one going to the men of the city, saying, “Come, 
see a man who told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Christ?” 
Another, “Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.” Philip had four daughters 
who did prophesy. Tryphena and Tryphosa were co-workers with the apostles in their 
mission, to whom they sent special messages of regard and acknowledgment of their 
labors in the gospel. A learned Jew, mighty in the Scriptures, was by Priscilla 
instructed in the way of the Lord more perfectly. Phebe is mentioned as a servant 
of Christ, and commended as such to the brethren. It is worthy of note, that the 
word servant , when applied to Tychicus, is rendered minister. Women professing 
godliness, should be translated preaching </p>
<p>The first announcement, on the day of Pentecost, 
was the fulfillment of ancient prophecy, that God’s spirit should be poured out 
upon daughters as well as sons, and they should prophesy. It is important that 
we be familiar with these facts, because woman has been so long circumscribed 
in her influence by the perverted application of the text, rendering it improper 
for her to speak in the assemblies of the people, “to edification, to exhortation, 
and to comfort.” </p>
<p>If these scriptures were read intelligently, 
we should not so learn Christ, as to exclude any from a position, where they might 
exert an influence for good to their fellow-beings. The epistle to the Corinthian 
church, where the supposed apostolic prohibition of women’s preaching is found, 
contains express directions how woman shall appear, when she prayeth or prophesyeth. 
Judge then whether this admonition, relative to speaking and asking questions, 
in the excited state of that church, should be regarded as a standing injunction 
on woman’s preaching , when that word was not used by the apostle. Where is the 
Scripture authority for the advice given to the early church, under peculiar circumstances, 
being binding on the church of the present day? Ecclesiastical history informs 
us, that for two or three hundred years, female ministers suffered martyrdom, 
in company with their brethren. </p>
<p>These things are too much lost sight of. They 
should be known, in order that we may be prepared to meet the assertion, so often 
made, that woman is stepping out of her appropriate sphere, when she shall attempt 
to instruct public assemblies. The present time particularly demands such investigation. 
It requires also, that “of yourselves ye should judge what is right,” 
that you should know the ground whereon you stand. This age is notable for its 
works of mercy and benevolence for the efforts that are made to reform the 
inebriate and the degraded, to relieve the oppressed and the suffering. Women 
as well as men are interested in these works of justice and mercy. They are efficient 
co-workers, their talents are called into profitable exercise, their labors are 
effective in each department of reform. The blessing to the merciful, to the peacemaker 
is equal to man and to woman. It is greatly to be deplored, now that she is increasingly 
qualified for usefulness, that any view should be presented, calculated to retard 
her labors of love. </p>
<p>Why should not woman seek to be a reformer? 
If she is to shrink from being such an iconoclast as shall “break the image 
of man’s lower worship,” as so long held up to view; if she is to fear to 
exercise her reason, and her noblest powers, lest she should be thought to “attempt 
to act the man,” and not “acknowledge his supremacy;” if she is 
to be satisfied with the narrow sphere assigned her by man, nor aspire to a higher, 
lest she should transcend the bounds of female delicacy; truly it is a mournful 
prospect for woman. We would admit all the difference, that our great and beneficent 
Creator has made, in the relation of man and woman, nor would we seek to disturb 
this relation; but we deny that the present position of woman, is her true sphere 
of usefulness: nor will she attain to this sphere, until the disabilities and 
disadvantages, religious, civil, and social, which impede her progress, are removed 
out of her way. These restrictions have enervated her mind and paralysed her powers. 
While man assumes, that the present is the original state designed for woman, 
that the existing “differences are not arbitrary nor the result of accident,” but grounded in nature; she will not make the necessary effort to obtain her just 
rights, lest it should subject her to the kind of scorn and contemptuous manner 
in which she has been spoken of. </p>
<p>So far from her “ambition leading her to 
attempt to act the man,” she needs all the encouragement she can receive, 
by the removal of obstacles from her path, in order that she may become a “true 
woman.” As it is desirable that man should act a manly and generous part, 
not “mannish,” so let woman be urged to exercise a dignified and womanly 
bearing, not womanish. Let her cultivate all the graces and proper accomplishments 
of her sex, but let not these degenerate into a kind of effeminacy, in which she 
is satisfied to be the mere plaything or toy of society, content with her outward 
adornings, and with the tone of flattery and fulsome adulation too often addressed 
to her. True, nature has made a difference in her configuration, her physical 
strength, her voice,  and we ask no change, we are satisfied with nature. 
But how has neglect and mismanagement increased this difference! It is our duty 
to develope these natural powers, by suitable exercise, so that they may be strengthened 
"by reason of use.” In the ruder state of society, woman is made to 
bear heavy burdens, while her “lord and master” walks idly by her side. 
In the civilization to which we have attained, if cultivated and refined woman 
would bring all her powers into use, she might engage in pursuits which she now 
shrinks from as beneath her proper vocation. The energies of men need not then 
be wholly devoted to the counting house and common business of life, in order 
that women in fashionable society, may be supported in their daily promenades 
and nightly visits to the theatre and ball room. </p>
<p>The appeal of Catharine Beecher to woman some 
years ago, leading her to aim at higher pursuits, was greatly encouraging. It 
gave earnest of an improved condition of woman. She says, “The time is coming, 
when woman will be taught to understand the construction of the human frame, the 
philosophical results from restricted exercise, unhealthy modes of dress, improper 
diet, and other causes, which are continually operating to destroy the health 
and life of the young… Woman has been but little aware of the high incitements 
which should stimulate to the cultivation of her noblest powers. The world is 
no longer to be governed by physical force, but by the influence which mind exerts 
over mind… Woman has never wakened to her highest destinies and holiest hopes. 
The time is coming when educated females will not be satisfied with the present 
objects of their low ambition. When a woman now leaves the immediate business 
of her own education, how often, how generally do we find her, sinking down into 
almost useless inactivity. To enjoy the social circle, to accomplish a little 
sewing, a little reading, a little domestic duty, to while away her hours in self-indulgence, 
or to enjoy the pleasures of domestic life, these are the highest objects 
at which many a woman of elevated mind, and accomplished education aims. And what 
does she find of sufficient interest to call forth her cultivated energies, and 
warm affections? But when the cultivation and development of the immortal mind 
shall be presented to woman, as her especial and delightful duty, and that too 
whatever be her relations in life; when by example and experience she shall have 
learned her power over the intellect and the affections, … then we shall not 
find woman, returning from the precincts of learning and wisdom, to pass lightly 
away the bright hours of her maturing youth. We shall not so often see her, seeking 
the light device to embroider on muslin and lace, (and I would add, the fashionable 
crochet work of the present day;) “but we shall see her, with the delighted 
glow of benevolence, seeking for immortal minds, whereon she may fasten durable 
and holy impressions, that shall never be effaced or wear away.” </p>
<p>A new generation of women is now upon the stage, 
improving the increased opportunities furnished for the acquirement of knowledge. 
Public education is coming to be regarded the right of the children of a republic. 
The hill of science is not so difficult of ascent as formerly represented by poets 
and painters; but by fact and demonstration smoothed down, so as to be accessible 
to the assumed weak capacity of woman. She is rising in the scale of being through 
this, as well as other means, and finding heightened pleasure and profit on the 
right hand and on the left. The study of Physiology, now introduced into our common 
schools, is engaging her attention, impressing the necessity of the observance 
of the laws of health. The intellectual Lyceum and instructive lecture room are 
becoming, to many, more attractive than the theatre and the ball room. The sickly 
and sentimental novel and pernicious romance are giving place to works, calculated 
to call forth the benevolent affections and higher nature. It is only by comparison 
that I would speak commendatory of these works of imagination. The frequent issue 
of them from the press is to be regretted. Their exciting contents, like stimulating 
drinks, when long indulged in, enervate the mind, unfitting it for the sober duties 
of life. </p>
<p>These duties are not to be limited by man. Nor 
will woman fulfill less her domestic relations, as the faithful companion of her 
chosen husband, and the fitting mother of her children, because she has a right 
estimate of her position and her responsibilities. Her self-respect will be increased; 
preserving the dignity of her being, she will not suffer herself to be degraded 
into a mere dependent. Nor will her feminine character be impaired. Instances 
are not few, of woman throwing off the encumbrances which bind her, and going 
forth in a manner worthy of herself, her creation, and her dignified calling. 
Did Elizabeth Fry lose any of her feminine qualities by the public walk into which 
she was called? Having performed the duties of a mother to a large family, feeling 
that she owed a labor of love to the poor prisoner, she was empowered by Him who 
sent her forth, to go to kings and crowned heads of the earth, and ask audience 
of these; and it was granted her. Did she lose the delicacy of woman by her acts? 
No. Her retiring modesty was characteristic of her to the latest period of her 
life. It was my privilege to enjoy her society some years ago, and I found all 
that belonged to the feminine in woman to true nobility, in a refined and 
purified moral nature. Is Dorothea Dix throwing off her womanly nature and appearance 
in the course she is pursuing? In finding duties abroad, has any, “refined 
man felt that something of beauty has gone forth from her?” To use the contemptuous 
word applied in the lecture alluded to, is she becoming “ mannish? “ Is she compromising her womanly dignity in going forth to seek to better the condition 
of the insane and afflicted? Is not a beautiful mind and a retiring modesty still 
conspicuous in her? </p>
<p>Indeed, I would ask, if this modesty is not 
attractive also, when manifested in the other sex? It was strikingly marked in 
Horace Mann when presiding over the late National Educational Convention in this 
city. The retiring modesty of William Ellery Channing, was beautiful, as well 
as of many others, who have filled dignified stations in society. These virtues, 
differing as they may in degree in man and woman, are of the same nature and call 
forth our admiration wherever manifested. </p>
<p>The noble courage of Grace Darling is justly 
honored, leading her to present herself on the coast of England, during the raging 
storm, in order to rescue the poor, suffering, shipwrecked mariner. Woman was 
not wanting in courage, in the early ages. In war and bloodshed this trait was 
often displayed. Grecian and Roman history have lauded and honored her in this 
character. English history records her courageous women too, for unhappily we 
have little but the records of war handed down to us. The courage of Joan of Arc 
was made the subject of a popular lecture not long ago, by one of our intelligent 
citizens. But more noble, moral daring is marking the female character at the 
present time, and better worthy of imitation. As these characteristics come to 
be appreciated in man too, his warlike acts, with all the miseries and horrors 
of the battle-ground, will sink into their merited oblivion, or be remembered 
only to be condemned. The heroism displayed in the tented field, must yield to 
the moral and Christian heroism which is shadowed in the signs of our times. </p>
<p>The lecturer regarded the announcement of woman’s 
achievements, and the offering of appropriate praise through the press, as a gross 
innovation upon the obscurity of female life he complained that the exhibition 
of the attainments of girls, in schools’ was now equal to that of boys, and the 
newspapers announce that “Miss Brown received the first prize for English 
grammar,” c. If he objected to so much excitement of emulation in schools, 
it would be well; for the most enlightened teachers discountenance these appeals 
to love of approbation and self-esteem. But, while prizes continue to be awarded, 
can any good reason be given, why the name of the girl should not be published 
as well as that of the boy? He spoke with scorn, that “we hear of Mrs. President 
so and so; and committees and secretaries of the same sex.” But if women 
can conduct their own business, by means of Presidents and Secretaries of their 
own sex, can he tell us why they should not? They will never make much progress 
in any moral movement, while they depend upon men to act for them. Do we shrink 
from reading the announcement that Mrs. Somerville is made an honorary member 
of a scientific association? That Miss Herschel has made some discoveries, and 
is prepared to take her equal part in science? Or that Miss Mitchell of Nantucket 
has lately discovered a planet, long looked for? I cannot conceive why “honor 
to whom honor is due” should not be rendered to woman as well as man; nor 
will it necessarily exalt her, or foster feminine pride. This propensity is found 
alike in male and female, and it should not be ministered to improperly, in either 
sex. </p>
<p>In treating upon the affections, the lecturer 
held out the idea, that as manifested in the sexes, they were opposite, if not 
somewhat antagonistic; and required a union, as in chemistry, to form a perfect 
whole. The simile appeared to me far from a correct illustration of the true union. 
Minds that can assimilate, spirits that are congenial, attach themselves to each 
other. It is the union of similar, not opposite affections, which are necessary 
for the perfection of the marriage bond. There seemed a want of proper delicacy 
in his representing man as being bold in the demonstration of the pure affection 
of love. In persons of refinement, true love seeks concealment in man, as well 
as in woman. I will not enlarge upon the subject, although it formed so great 
a part of his lecture. The contrast drawn seemed a fallacy, as has much, very 
much that has been presented, in the sickly sentimental strains of the poet, from 
age to age. </p>
<p>The question is often asked, “What does 
woman want, more than she enjoys? What is she seeking to obtain? Of what rights 
is she deprived? What privileges are withheld from her? I answer, she asks nothing 
as favor, but as right, she wants to be acknowledged a moral, responsible being. 
She is seeking not to be governed by laws, in the making of which she has no voice. 
She is deprived of almost every right in civil society, and is a cypher in the 
nation, except in the right of presenting a petition. In religious society her 
disabilities, as already pointed out, have greatly retarded her progress. Her 
exclusion from the pulpit or ministry her duties marked out for her by her 
equal brother man, subject to creeds, rules, and disciplines made for her by him this 
is unworthy her true dignity. In marriage, there is assumed superiority, on the 
part of the husband, and admitted inferiority, with a promise of obedience, on 
the part of the wife. This subject calls loudly for examination, in order that 
the wrong may be redressed. Customs suited to darker ages in Eastern countries, 
are not binding upon enlightened society. The solemn covenant of marriage may 
be entered into without these lordly assumptions, and humiliating concessions 
and promises. </p>
<p>There are large Christian denominations who 
do not recognise such degrading relations of husband and wife. They ask no magisterial 
or ministerial aid to legalize or to sanctify this union. But acknowledging themselves 
in the presence of the Highest, and invoking his assistance, they come under reciprocal 
obligations of fidelity and affection, before suitable witnesses. Experience and 
observation go to prove, that there may be as much harmony, to say the least, 
in such a union, and as great purity and permanency of affection, as can exist 
where the more common custom or form is observed. The distinctive relations of 
husband and wife, of father and mother of a family are sacredly preserved, without 
the assumption of authority on the one part, or the promise of obedience on the 
other. There is nothing in such a marriage degrading to woman. She does not compromise 
her dignity or self-respect; but enters married life upon equal ground, by the 
side of her husband. By proper education, she understands her duties, physical, 
intellectual and moral; and fulfilling these, she is a help meet, in the true 
sense of the word. </p>
<p>I tread upon delicate ground in alluding to 
the institutions of religious associations; but the subject is of so much importance, 
that all which relates to the position of woman, should be examined, apart from 
the undue veneration which ancient usage receives.</p>


<blockquote class="extract-verse-rw"> 
<p>Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone </p>
<p>To reverence what is ancient, and can plead</p> 
<p>A course of long observance for its use,</p> 
<p>That even servitude, the worst of ills,</p>  
<p>Because delivered down from sire to son,</p>
<p>Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So with woman. She has so long been subject 
to the disabilities and restrictions, with which her progress has been embarrassed, 
that she has become enervated, her mind to some extent paralysed; and, like those 
still more degraded by personal bondage, she hugs her chains. Liberty is often 
presented in its true light, but it is liberty for man. 
<blockquote class="extract-verse-rw"> 
<p>Whose freedom is by suffrance, and at will</p>
<p>Of a superior he is never free. </p>
<p>Who lives, and is not weary of a life </p>
<p>Exposed to manacles, deserves them well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not, however, go so far, either as regards 
the abject slave or woman; for in both cases they may be so degraded by the crushing 
influences around them, that they may not be sensible of the blessing of Freedom. 
Liberty is not less a blessing, because oppression has so long darkened the mind 
that it cannot appreciate it. I would therefore urge, that woman be placed in 
such a situation in society, by the yielding of her rights, and have such opportunities 
for growth and development, as shall raise her from this low, enervated and paralysed 
condition, to a full appreciation of the blessing of entire freedom of mind. </p>
<p>It is with reluctance that I make the demand 
for the political rights of woman, because this claim is so distasteful to the 
age. Woman shrinks, in the present state of society, from taking any interest 
in politics. The events of the French Revolution, and the claim for woman’s rights 
are held up to her as a warning. But let us not look at the excesses of women 
alone, at that period; but remember that the age was marked with extravagances 
and wickedness in men as well as women. Indeed, political life abounds with these 
excesses, and with shameful outrage. Who knows, but that if woman acted her part 
in governmental affairs, there might be an entire change in the turmoil of political 
life. It becomes man to speak modestly of his ability to act without her. If woman’s 
judgment were exercised, why might she not aid in making the laws by which she 
is governed? Lord Brougham remarked that the works of Harriet Martineau upon Political 
Economy were not excelled by those of any political writer of the present time. 
The first few chapters of her Society in America, her views of a Republic, and 
of Government generally, furnish evidence of woman’s capacity to embrace subjects 
of universal interest. </p>
<p>Far be it from me to encourage woman to vote, 
or to take an active part in politics, in the present state of our government. 
Her right to the elective franchise however, is the same, and should be yielded 
to her, whether she exercise that right or not. Would that man too, would have 
no participation in a government based upon the life-taking principle upon 
retaliation and the sword. It is unworthy a Christian nation. But when, in the 
diffusion of light and intelligence, a convention shall be called to make regulations 
for self-government on Christian, non-resistant principles, I can see no good 
reason, why woman should not participate in such an assemblage, taking part equally 
with man. </p>
<p>Walker, of Cincinnati, in his Introduction to 
American Law, says: “With regard to political rights, females form a positive 
exception to the general doctrine of equality. They have no part or lot in the 
formation or administration of government. They cannot vote or hold office. We 
require them to contribute their share in the way of taxes, to the support of 
government, but allow them no voice in its direction. We hold them amenable to 
the laws when made, but allow them no share in making them. This language, applied 
to males, would be the exact definition of political slavery; applied to females, 
custom does not teach us so to regard it.” Woman, however, is beginning so 
to regard it. </p>
<p>"The law of husband and wife, as you gather 
it from the books, is a disgrace to any civilized nation. The theory of the law 
degrades the wife almost to the level of slaves. When a woman marries, we call 
her condition coverture, and speak of her as a femme covert. The old writers 
call the husband baron, and sometimes, in plain English, lord…  The merging 
of her name in that of her husband is emblematic of the fate of all her legal 
rights. The torch of Hymen serves but to light the pile, on which these rights 
are offered up. The legal theory is, that marriage makes the husband and wife 
one person, and that person is the husband. On this subject, reform is loudly 
called for. There is no foundation in reason or expediency, for the absolute and 
slavish subjection of the wife to the husband, which forms the foundation of the 
present legal relations. Were woman, in point of fact, the abject thing which 
the law, in theory, considers her to be when married, she would not be worthy 
the companionship of man.” </p>
<p>I would ask if such a code of laws does not 
require change? If such a condition of the wife in society does not claim redress? 
On no good ground can reform be delayed. Blackstone says, “The very being 
and legal existence of woman is suspended during marriage, incorporated or 
consolidated into that of her husband, under whose protection and cover she performs 
every thing.” Hurlbut, in his Essays upon Human Rights, says: “The laws 
touching the rights of woman are at variance with the laws of the Creator. rights 
are human rights, and pertain to human beings, without distinction of sex. Laws 
should not be made for man or for woman, but for mankind. Man was not born to 
command, nor woman to obey… The law of France, Spain, and Holland, and one 
of our own States, Louisiana, recognizes the wife’s right to property, more than 
the common law of England… The laws depriving woman of the right of property 
is handed down to us from dark and feudal times, and not consistent with the wiser, 
better, purer spirit of the age. The wife is a mere pensioner on the bounty of 
her husband. Her lost rights are appropriated to himself. But justice and benevolence 
are abroad in our land, awakening the spirit of inquiry and innovation; and the 
Gothic fabric of the British law will fall before it, save where it is based upon 
the foundation of truth and justice.” </p>
<p>May these statements lead you to reflect upon 
this subject, that you may know what woman’s condition is in society what 
her restrictions are, and seek to remove them. In how many cases in our country, 
the husband and wife begin life together, and by equal industry and united effort 
accumulate to themselves a comfortable home. In the event of the death of the 
wife, the household remains undisturbed, his farm or his workshop is not broken 
up, or in any way molested. But when the husband dies, he either gives his wife 
a portion of their joint accumulation, or the law apportions to her a share; the 
homestead is broken up, and she is dispossessed of that which she earned equally 
with him; for what she lacked in physical strength, she made up in constancy of 
labor and toil, day and evening. The sons then coming into possession of the property, 
as has been the custom until of latter time, speak of having to keep their mother, 
when she in reality is aiding to keep them. Where is the justice of this state 
of things? The change in the law of this State and of New York, in relation to 
the property of the wife, go to a limited extend, toward the redress of these 
wrongs; but they are far more extensive, and involve much more, than I have time 
this evening to point out. </p>
<p>On no good ground can the legal existence of 
the wife be suspended during marriage, and her property surrendered to her husband. 
In the intelligent ranks of society, the wife may not in point of fact, be so 
degraded as the law would degrade her; because public sentiment is above the law. 
Still, while the law stands, she is liable to the disabilities which it imposes. 
Among the ignorant classes of society, woman is made to bear heavy burdens, and 
is degraded almost to the level of the slave. </p>
<p>There are many instances now in our city, where 
the wife suffers much from the power of the husband to claim all that she can 
earn with her own hands. In my intercourse with the poorer class of people, I 
have known cases of extreme cruelty, from the hard earnings of the wife being 
thus robbed by the husband, and no redress at law. </p>
<p>An article in one of the daily papers lately, 
presented the condition of needle women in England. There might be a presentation 
of this class in our own country, which would make the heart bleed. Public attention 
should be turned to this subject, in order that avenues of more profitable employment 
may be opened to women. There are many kinds of business which women, equally 
with men, may follow with respectability and success. Their talents and energies 
should be called forth, and their powers brought into the highest exercise. The 
efforts of women in France are sometimes pointed to in ridicule and sarcasm, but 
depend upon it, the opening of profitable employment to women in that country, 
is doing much for the enfranchisement of the sex. In England also, it is not an 
uncommon thing for a wife to take up the business of her deceased husband and 
carry it on with success. </p>
<p>Our respected British Consul stated to me a 
circumstance which occurred some years ago, of an editor of a political paper 
having died in England; it was proposed to his wife, an able writer, to take the 
editorial chair. She accepted. The patronage of the paper was greatly increased, 
and she a short time since retired from her labors with a handsome fortune. In 
that country however, the opportunities are by no means general for Woman’s elevation. 
</p>
<p>In visiting the public school in London, a few 
years since, I noticed that the boys were employed in linear drawing, and instructed 
upon the black board, in the higher branches of arithmetic and mathematics; while 
the girls, after a short exercise in the mere elements of arithmetic, were seated, 
during the bright hours of the morning, stitching wristbands. I asked, Why there 
should be this difference made; why they too should not have the black board? 
The answer was, that they would not probably fill any station in society requiring 
such knowledge. </p>
<p>But the demand for a more extended education 
will not cease, until girls and boys have equal instruction, in all the departments 
of useful knowledge. We have as yet no high school for girls in this state. The 
normal school may be a preparation for such an establishment. In the late convention 
for general education, it was cheering to hear the testimony borne to woman’s 
capabilities for head teachers of the public schools. A resolution there offered 
for equal salaries to male and female teachers, when equally qualified, as practised 
in Louisiana, I regret to say was checked in its passage, by Bishop Potter; by 
him who has done so much for the encouragement of education, and who gave his 
countenance and influence to that convention. Still the fact of such a resolution 
being offered, augurs a time coming for woman, which she may well hail. At the 
last examination of the public schools in this city, one of the alumni delivered 
an address on Woman, not as is too common, in eulogistic strains, but directing 
the attention to the injustice done to woman in her position in society, in a 
variety of ways. The unequal wages she receives for her constant toil, c., presenting 
facts calculated to arouse attention to the subject. </p>
<p>Women’s property has been taxed, equally with 
that of men’s, to sustain colleges endowed by the states; but they have not been 
permitted to enter those high seminaries of learning. Within a few years, however, 
some colleges have been instituted, where young women are admitted, nearly upon 
equal terms with young men; and numbers are availing themselves of their long 
denied rights. This is among the signs of the times, indicative of an advance 
for women. The book of knowledge is not opened to her in vain. Already is she 
aiming to occupy important posts of honor and profit in our country. We have three 
female editors in our state some in other states of the Union. Numbers are 
entering the medical profession one received a diploma last year; others 
are preparing for a like result. </p>
<p>Let woman then go on not asking as favor, 
but claiming as right, the removal of all the hindrances to her elevation in the 
scale of being let her receive encouragement for the proper cultivation of 
all her powers, so that she may enter profitably into the active business of life; 
employing her own hands, in ministering to her necessities, strengthening her 
physical being by proper exercise, and observance of the laws of health. Let her 
not be ambitious to display a fair hand, and to promenade the fashionable streets 
of our city, but rather, coveting earnestly the best gifts, let her strive to 
occupy such walks in society, as will befit her true dignity in all the relations 
of life. No fear that she will then transcend the proper limits of female delicacy. 
True modesty will be as fully preserved, in acting out those important vocations 
to which she may be called, as in the nursery or at the fireside, ministering 
to man’s self-indulgence. </p>
<p>Then in the marriage union, the independence 
of the husband and wife will be equal, their dependence mutual, and their obligations 
reciprocal. </p>
<p>In conclusion, let me say, “Credit not 
the old fashioned absurdity, that woman’s is a secondary lot, ministering to the 
necessities of her lord and master! It is a higher destiny I would award you. 
If your immortality is as complete, and your gift of mind as capable as ours, 
of increase and elevation, I would put no wisdom of mine against God’s evident 
allotment. I would charge you to water the undying bud, and give it healthy culture, 
and open its beauty to the sun and then you may hope, that when your life 
is bound up with another, you will go on equally, and in a fellowship that shall 
pervade every earthly interest."
