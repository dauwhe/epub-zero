<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<p>He had been to Amsterdam, Mr Bankes was saying as he strolled
across the lawn with Lily Briscoe. He had seen the Rembrandts. He
had been to Madrid. Unfortunately, it was Good Friday and the Prado
was shut. He had been to Rome. Had Miss Briscoe never been to Rome?
Oh, she should—It would be a wonderful experience for her—the
Sistine Chapel; Michael Angelo; and Padua, with its Giottos. His
wife had been in bad health for many years, so that their
sight-seeing had been on a modest scale.</p>
<p>She had been to Brussels; she had been to Paris but only for a
flying visit to see an aunt who was ill. She had been to Dresden;
there were masses of pictures she had not seen; however, Lily
Briscoe reflected, perhaps it was better not to see pictures: they
only made one hopelessly discontented with one's own work. Mr
Bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far. We can't
all be Titians and we can't all be Darwins, he said; at the same
time he doubted whether you could have your Darwin and your Titian
if it weren't for humble people like ourselves. Lily would have
liked to pay him a compliment; you're not humble, Mr Bankes, she
would have liked to have said. But he did not want compliments
(most men do, she thought), and she was a little ashamed of her
impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was
saying did not apply to pictures. Anyhow, said Lily, tossing off
her little insincerity, she would always go on painting, because it
interested her. Yes, said Mr Bankes, he was sure she would, and, as
they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had
difficulty in finding subjects in London when they turned and saw
the Ramsays. So that is marriage, Lily thought, a man and a woman
looking at a girl throwing a ball. That is what Mrs Ramsay tried to
tell me the other night, she thought. For she was wearing a green
shawl, and they were standing close together watching Prue and
Jasper throwing catches. And suddenly the meaning which, for no
reason at all, as perhaps they are stepping out of the Tube or
ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical,
making them representative, came upon them, and made them in the
dusk standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husband and wife.
Then, after an instant, the symbolical outline which transcended
the real figures sank down again, and they became, as they met
them, Mr and Mrs Ramsay watching the children throwing catches. But
still for a moment, though Mrs Ramsay greeted them with her usual
smile (oh, she's thinking we're going to get married, Lily thought)
and said, "I have triumphed tonight,” meaning that for once Mr
Bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own
lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly; still, for one
moment, there was a sense of things having been blown apart, of
space, of irresponsibility as the ball soared high, and they
followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped
branches. In the failing light they all looked sharp-edged and
ethereal and divided by great distances. Then, darting backwards
over the vast space (for it seemed as if solidity had vanished
altogether), Prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball
brilliantly high up in her left hand, and her mother said, "Haven't
they come back yet?” whereupon the spell was broken. Mr Ramsay felt
free now to laugh out loud at the thought that Hume had stuck in a
bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the Lord's
Prayer, and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study. Mrs
Ramsay, bringing Prue back into throwing catches again, from which
she had escaped, asked,</p>
<p>“Did Nancy go with them?”</p>
