<p>Yes, that is their boat, Lily Briscoe decided, standing on the
edge of the lawn. It was the boat with greyish-brown sails, which
she saw now flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the
bay. There he sits, she thought, and the children are quite silent
still. And she could not reach him either. The sympathy she had not
given him weighed her down. It made it difficult for her to
paint.</p>
<p>She had always found him difficult. She never had been able to
praise him to his face, she remembered. And that reduced their
relationship to something neutral, without that element of sex in
it which made his manner to Minta so gallant, almost gay. He would
pick a flower for her, lend her his books. But could he believe
that Minta read them? She dragged them about the garden, sticking
in leaves to mark the place.</p>
<p>“D'you remember, Mr Carmichael?” she was inclined to ask,
looking at the old man. But he had pulled his hat half over his
forehead; he was asleep, or he was dreaming, or he was lying there
catching words, she supposed.</p>
<p>“D'you remember?” she felt inclined to ask him as she passed
him, thinking again of Mrs Ramsay on the beach; the cask bobbing up
and down; and the pages flying. Why, after all these years had that
survived, ringed round, lit up, visible to the last detail, with
all before it blank and all after it blank, for miles and
miles?</p>
<p>“Is it a boat? Is it a cork?” she would say, Lily repeated,
turning back, reluctantly again, to her canvas. Heaven be praised
for it, the problem of space remained, she thought, taking up her
brush again. It glared at her. The whole mass of the picture was
poised upon that weight. Beautiful and bright it should be on the
surface, feathery and evanescent, one colour melting into another
like the colours on a butterfly's wing; but beneath the fabric must
be clamped together with bolts of iron. It was to be a thing you
could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge
with a team of horses. And she began to lay on a red, a grey, and
she began to model her way into the hollow there. At the same time,
she seemed to be sitting beside Mrs Ramsay on the beach.</p>
<p>“Is it a boat? Is it a cask?” Mrs Ramsay said. And she began
hunting round for her spectacles. And she sat, having found them,
silent, looking out to sea. And Lily, painting steadily, felt as if
a door had opened, and one went in and stood gazing silently about
in a high cathedral-like place, very dark, very solemn. Shouts came
from a world far away. Steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the
horizon. Charles threw stones and sent them skipping.</p>
<p>Mrs Ramsay sat silent. She was glad, Lily thought, to rest in
silence, uncommunicative; to rest in the extreme obscurity of human
relationships. Who knows what we are, what we feel? Who knows even
at the moment of intimacy, This is knowledge? Aren't things spoilt
then, Mrs Ramsay may have asked (it seemed to have happened so
often, this silence by her side) by saying them? Aren't we more
expressive thus? The moment at least seemed extraordinarily
fertile. She rammed a little hole in the sand and covered it up, by
way of burying in it the perfection of the moment. It was like a
drop of silver in which one dipped and illumined the darkness of
the past.</p>
<p>Lily stepped back to get her canvas—so—into perspective. It was
an odd road to be walking, this of painting. Out and out one went,
further, until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank,
perfectly alone, over the sea. And as she dipped into the blue
paint, she dipped too into the past there. Now Mrs Ramsay got up,
she remembered. It was time to go back to the house—time for
luncheon. And they all walked up from the beach together, she
walking behind with William Bankes, and there was Minta in front of
them with a hole in her stocking. How that little round hole of
pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them! How William Bankes
deplored it, without, so far as she could remember, saying anything
about it! It meant to him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt
and disorder, and servants leaving and beds not made at mid-day—all
the things he most abhorred. He had a way of shuddering and
spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which
he did now—holding his hand in front of him. And Minta walked on
ahead, and presumably Paul met her and she went off with Paul in
the garden.</p>
<p>The Rayleys, thought Lily Briscoe, squeezing her tube of green
paint. She collected her impressions of the Rayleys. Their lives
appeared to her in a series of scenes; one, on the staircase at
dawn. Paul had come in and gone to bed early; Minta was late. There
was Minta, wreathed, tinted, garish on the stairs about three
o'clock in the morning. Paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a
poker in case of burglars. Minta was eating a sandwich, standing
half-way up by a window, in the cadaverous early morning light, and
the carpet had a hole in it. But what did they say? Lily asked
herself, as if by looking she could hear them. Minta went on eating
her sandwich, annoyingly, while he spoke something violent, abusing
her, in a mutter so as not to wake the children, the two little
boys. He was withered, drawn; she flamboyant, careless. For things
had worked loose after the first year or so; the marriage had
turned out rather badly.</p>
<p>And this, Lily thought, taking the green paint on her brush,
this making up scenes about them, is what we call "knowing” people,
"thinking” of them, "being fond” of them! Not a word of it was
true; she had made it up; but it was what she knew them by all the
same. She went on tunnelling her way into her picture, into the
past.</p>
<p>Another time, Paul said he "played chess in coffee-houses.” She
had built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too.
She remembered how, as he said it, she thought how he rang up the
servant, and she said, "Mrs Rayley's out, sir,” and he decided that
he would not come home either. She saw him sitting in the corner of
some lugubrious place where the smoke attached itself to the red
plush seats, and the waitresses got to know you, and he played
chess with a little man who was in the tea trade and lived at
Surbiton, but that was all Paul knew about him. And then Minta was
out when he came home and then there was that scene on the stairs,
when he got the poker in case of burglars (no doubt to frighten her
too) and spoke so bitterly, saying she had ruined his life. At any
rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near
Rickmansworth, things were horribly strained. Paul took her down
the garden to look at the Belgian hares which he bred, and Minta
followed them, singing, and put her bare arm on his shoulder, lest
he should tell her anything.</p>
<p>Minta was bored by hares, Lily thought. But Minta never gave
herself away. She never said things like that about playing chess
in coffee- houses. She was far too conscious, far too wary. But to
go on with their story—they had got through the dangerous stage by
now. She had been staying with them last summer some time and the
car broke down and Minta had to hand him his tools. He sat on the
road mending the car, and it was the way she gave him the
tools—business-like, straightforward, friendly—that proved it was
all right now. They were "in love” no longer; no, he had taken up
with another woman, a serious woman, with her hair in a plait and a
case in her hand (Minta had described her gratefully, almost
admiringly), who went to meetings and shared Paul's views (they had
got more and more pronounced) about the taxation of land values and
a capital levy. Far from breaking up the marriage, that alliance
had righted it. They were excellent friends, obviously, as he sat
on the road and she handed him his tools.</p>
<p>So that was the story of the Rayleys, Lily thought. She imagined
herself telling it to Mrs Ramsay, who would be full of curiosity to
know what had become of the Rayleys. She would feel a little
triumphant, telling Mrs Ramsay that the marriage had not been a
success.</p>
<p>But the dead, thought Lily, encountering some obstacle in her
design which made her pause and ponder, stepping back a foot or so,
oh, the dead! she murmured, one pitied them, one brushed them
aside, one had even a little contempt for them. They are at our
mercy. Mrs Ramsay has faded and gone, she thought. We can over-ride
her wishes, improve away her limited, old-fashioned ideas. She
recedes further and further from us. Mockingly she seemed to see
her there at the end of the corridor of years saying, of all
incongruous things, "Marry, marry!” (sitting very upright early in
the morning with the birds beginning to cheep in the garden
outside). And one would have to say to her, It has all gone against
your wishes. They're happy like that; I'm happy like this. Life has
changed completely. At that all her being, even her beauty, became
for a moment, dusty and out of date. For a moment Lily, standing
there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the Rayleys,
triumphed over Mrs Ramsay, who would never know how Paul went to
coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and
Minta handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never
married, not even William Bankes.</p>
<p>Mrs Ramsay had planned it. Perhaps, had she lived, she would
have compelled it. Already that summer he was "the kindest of men."
He was "the first scientist of his age, my husband says.” He was
also "poor William—it makes me so unhappy, when I go to see him, to
find nothing nice in his house—no one to arrange the flowers.” So
they were sent for walks together, and she was told, with that
faint touch of irony that made Mrs Ramsay slip through one's
fingers, that she had a scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was
so exact. What was this mania of hers for marriage? Lily wondered,
stepping to and fro from her easel.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish
light seemed to burn in her mind, covering Paul Rayley, issuing
from him. It rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration
by savages on a distant beach. She heard the roar and the crackle.
The whole sea for miles round ran red and gold. Some winey smell
mixed with it and intoxicated her, for she felt again her own
headlong desire to throw herself off the cliff and be drowned
looking for a pearl brooch on a beach. And the roar and the crackle
repelled her with fear and disgust, as if while she saw its
splendour and power she saw too how it fed on the treasure of the
house, greedily, disgustingly, and she loathed it. But for a sight,
for a glory it surpassed everything in her experience, and burnt
year after year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge
of the sea, and one had only to say "in love” and instantly, as
happened now, up rose Paul's fire again. And it sank and she said
to herself, laughing, "The Rayleys"; how Paul went to coffee-houses
and played chess.)</p>
<p>She had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though, she
thought. She had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had
flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle, and
need never marry anybody, and she had felt an enormous exultation.
She had felt, now she could stand up to Mrs Ramsay—a tribute to the
astonishing power that Mrs Ramsay had over one. Do this, she said,
and one did it. Even her shadow at the window with James was full
of authority. She remembered how William Bankes had been shocked by
her neglect of the significance of mother and son. Did she not
admire their beauty? he said. But William, she remembered, had
listened to her with his wise child's eyes when she explained how
it was not irreverence: how a light there needed a shadow there and
so on. She did not intend to disparage a subject which, they
agreed, Raphael had treated divinely. She was not cynical. Quite
the contrary. Thanks to his scientific mind he understood—a proof
of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted
her enormously. One could talk of painting then seriously to a man.
Indeed, his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life.
She loved William Bankes.</p>
<p>They went to Hampton Court and he always left her, like the
perfect gentleman he was, plenty of time to wash her hands, while
he strolled by the river. That was typical of their relationship.
Many things were left unsaid. Then they strolled through the
courtyards, and admired, summer after summer, the proportions and
the flowers, and he would tell her things, about perspective, about
architecture, as they walked, and he would stop to look at a tree,
or the view over the lake, and admire a child—(it was his great
grief—he had no daughter) in the vague aloof way that was natural
to a man who spent spent so much time in laboratories that the
world when he came out seemed to dazzle him, so that he walked
slowly, lifted his hand to screen his eyes and paused, with his
head thrown back, merely to breathe the air. Then he would tell her
how his housekeeper was on her holiday; he must buy a new carpet
for the staircase. Perhaps she would go with him to buy a new
carpet for the staircase. And once something led him to talk about
the Ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had been
wearing a grey hat; she was not more than nineteen or twenty. She
was astonishingly beautiful. There he stood looking down the avenue
at Hampton Court as if he could see her there among the
fountains.</p>
<p>She looked now at the drawing-room step. She saw, through
William's eyes, the shape of a woman, peaceful and silent, with
downcast eyes. She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day,
Lily thought). Her eyes were bent. She would never lift them. Yes,
thought Lily, looking intently, I must have seen her look like
that, but not in grey; nor so still, nor so young, nor so peaceful.
The figure came readily enough. She was astonishingly beautiful, as
William said. But beauty was not everything. Beauty had this
penalty—it came too readily, came too completely. It stilled
life—froze it. One forgot the little agitations; the flush, the
pallor, some queer distortion, some light or shadow, which made the
face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw
for ever after. It was simpler to smooth that all out under the
cover of beauty. But what was the look she had, Lily wondered, when
she clapped her deer-stalkers's hat on her head, or ran across the
grass, or scolded Kennedy, the gardener? Who could tell her? Who
could help her?</p>
<p>Against her will she had come to the surface, and found herself
half out of the picture, looking, little dazedly, as if at unreal
things, at Mr Carmichael. He lay on his chair with his hands
clasped above his paunch not reading, or sleeping, but basking like
a creature gorged with existence. His book had fallen on to the
grass.</p>
<p>She wanted to go straight up to him and say, "Mr Carmichael!"
Then he would look up benevolently as always, from his smoky vague
green eyes. But one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to
say to them. And she wanted to say not one thing, but everything.
Little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said
nothing. "About life, about death; about Mrs Ramsay"—no, she
thought, one could say nothing to nobody. The urgency of the moment
always missed its mark. Words fluttered sideways and struck the
object inches too low. Then one gave it up; then the idea sunk back
again; then one became like most middle-aged people, cautious,
furtive, with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual
apprehension. For how could one express in words these emotions of
the body? express that emptiness there? (She was looking at the
drawing-room steps; they looked extraordinarily empty.) It was
one's body feeling, not one's mind. The physical sensations that
went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely
unpleasant. To want and not to have, sent all up her body a
hardness, a hollowness, a strain. And then to want and not to
have—to want and want—how that wrung the heart, and wrung it again
and again! Oh, Mrs Ramsay! she called out silently, to that essence
which sat by the boat, that abstract one made of her, that woman in
grey, as if to abuse her for having gone, and then having gone,
come back again. It had seemed so safe, thinking of her. Ghost,
air, nothingness, a thing you could play with easily and safely at
any time of day or night, she had been that, and then suddenly she
put her hand out and wrung the heart thus. Suddenly, the empty
drawing-room steps, the frill of the chair inside, the puppy
tumbling on the terrace, the whole wave and whisper of the garden
became like curves and arabesques flourishing round a centre of
complete emptiness.</p>
<p>“What does it mean? How do you explain it all?” she wanted to
say, turning to Mr Carmichael again. For the whole world seemed to
have dissolved in this early morning hour into a pool of thought, a
deep basin of reality, and one could almost fancy that had Mr
Carmichael spoken, for instance, a little tear would have rent the
surface pool. And then? Something would emerge. A hand would be
shoved up, a blade would be flashed. It was nonsense of course.</p>
<p>A curious notion came to her that he did after all hear the
things she could not say. He was an inscrutable old man, with the
yellow stain on his beard, and his poetry, and his puzzles, sailing
serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants, so that she
thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn
to fish up anything he wanted. She looked at her picture. That
would have been his answer, presumably—how "you” and "I” and "she"
pass and vanish; nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not
paint. Yet it would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be
rolled up and flung under a sofa; yet even so, even of a picture
like that, it was true. One might say, even of this scrawl, not of
that actual picture, perhaps, but of what it attempted, that it
"remained for ever,” she was going to say, or, for the words spoken
sounded even to herself, too boastful, to hint, wordlessly; when,
looking at the picture, she was surprised to find that she could
not see it. Her eyes were full of a hot liquid (she did not think
of tears at first) which, without disturbing the firmness of her
lips, made the air thick, rolled down her cheeks. She had perfect
control of herself—Oh, yes!—in every other way. Was she crying then
for Mrs Ramsay, without being aware of any unhappiness? She
addressed old Mr Carmichael again. What was it then? What did it
mean? Could things thrust their hands up and grip one; could the
blade cut; the fist grasp? Was there no safety? No learning by
heart of the ways of the world? No guide, no shelter, but all was
miracle, and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air?
Could it be, even for elderly people, that this was
life?—startling, unexpected, unknown? For one moment she felt that
if they both got up, here, now on the lawn, and demanded an
explanation, why was it so short, why was it so inexplicable, said
it with violence, as two fully equipped human beings from whom
nothing should be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll itself
up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes would form into
shape; if they shouted loud enough Mrs Ramsay would return. "Mrs
Ramsay!” she said aloud, "Mrs Ramsay!” The tears ran down her
face.</p>
