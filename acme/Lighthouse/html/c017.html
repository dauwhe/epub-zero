<p>But what have I done with my life? thought Mrs Ramsay, taking
her place at the head of the table, and looking at all the plates
making white circles on it. "William, sit by me,” she said. "Lily,"
she said, wearily, "over there.” They had that—Paul Rayley and
Minta Doyle—she, only this—an infinitely long table and plates and
knives. At the far end was her husband, sitting down, all in a
heap, frowning. What at? She did not know. She did not mind. She
could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection
for him. She had a sense of being past everything, through
everything, out of everything, as she helped the soup, as if there
was an eddy—there— and one could be in it, or one could be out of
it, and she was out of it. It's all come to an end, she thought,
while they came in one after another, Charles Tansley—"Sit there,
please,” she said—Augustus Carmichael—and sat down. And meanwhile
she waited, passively, for some one to answer her, for something to
happen. But this is not a thing, she thought, ladling out soup,
that one says.</p>
<p>Raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy—that was what she was
thinking, this was what she was doing—ladling out soup—she felt,
more and more strongly, outside that eddy; or as if a shade had
fallen, and, robbed of colour, she saw things truly. The room (she
looked round it) was very shabby. There was no beauty anywhere. She
forebore to look at Mr Tansley. Nothing seemed to have merged. They
all sat separate. And the whole of the effort of merging and
flowing and creating rested on her. Again she felt, as a fact
without hostility, the sterility of men, for if she did not do it
nobody would do it, and so, giving herself a little shake that one
gives a watch that has stopped, the old familiar pulse began
beating, as the watch begins ticking—one, two, three, one, two,
three. And so on and so on, she repeated, listening to it,
sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard
a weak flame with a news-paper. And so then, she concluded,
addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to William
Bankes—poor man! who had no wife, and no children and dined alone
in lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now
strong enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as
a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet
hardly wants to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he
would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of
the sea.</p>
<p>“Did you find your letters? I told them to put them in the hall
for you,” she said to William Bankes.</p>
<p>Lily Briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's
land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going
inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try
at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading
ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>How old she looks, how worn she looks, Lily thought, and how
remote. Then when she turned to William Bankes, smiling, it was as
if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again, and
Lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved, Why does
she pity him? For that was the impression she gave, when she told
him that his letters were in the hall. Poor William Bankes, she
seemed to be saying, as if her own weariness had been partly
pitying people, and the life in her, her resolve to live again, had
been stirred by pity. And it was not true, Lily thought; it was one
of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to
arise from some need of her own rather than of other people's. He
is not in the least pitiable. He has his work, Lily said to
herself. She remembered, all of a sudden as if she had found a
treasure, that she had her work. In a flash she saw her picture,
and thought, Yes, I shall put the tree further in the middle; then
I shall avoid that awkward space. That's what I shall do. That's
what has been puzzling me. She took up the salt cellar and put it
down again on a flower pattern in the table-cloth, so as to remind
herself to move the tree.</p>
<p>“It's odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post,
yet one always wants one's letters,” said Mr Bankes.</p>
<p>What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down
his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept
clean, as if, Lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to
the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to
make sure of his meals. Everything about him had that meagre
fixity, that bare unloveliness. But nevertheless, the fact
remained, it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at
them. She liked his eyes; they were blue, deep set,
frightening.</p>
<p>“Do you write many letters, Mr Tansley?” asked Mrs Ramsay,
pitying him too, Lily supposed; for that was true of Mrs Ramsay—she
pitied men always as if they lacked something—women never, as if
they had something. He wrote to his mother; otherwise he did not
suppose he wrote one letter a month, said Mr Tansley, shortly.</p>
<p>For he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended
to by these silly women. He had been reading in his room, and now
he came down and it all seemed to him silly, superficial, flimsy.
Why did they dress? He had come down in his ordinary clothes. He
had not got any dress clothes. "One never gets anything worth
having by post"—that was the sort of thing they were always saying.
They made men say that sort of thing. Yes, it was pretty well true,
he thought. They never got anything worth having from one year's
end to another. They did nothing but talk, talk, talk, eat, eat,
eat. It was the women's fault. Women made civilisation impossible
with all their "charm,” all their silliness.</p>
<p>“No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs Ramsay,” he said,
asserting himself. He liked her; he admired her; he still thought
of the man in the drain-pipe looking up at her; but he felt it
necessary to assert himself.</p>
<p>He was really, Lily Briscoe thought, in spite of his eyes, but
then look at his nose, look at his hands, the most uncharming human
being she had ever met. Then why did she mind what he said? Women
can't write, women can't paint—what did that matter coming from
him, since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason
helpful to him, and that was why he said it? Why did her whole
being bow, like corn under a wind, and erect itself again from this
abasement only with a great and rather painful effort? She must
make it once more. There's the sprig on the table-cloth; there's my
painting; I must move the tree to the middle; that matters—nothing
else. Could she not hold fast to that, she asked herself, and not
lose her temper, and not argue; and if she wanted revenge take it
by laughing at him?</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr Tansley,” she said, "do take me to the Lighthouse with
you. I should so love it.”</p>
<p>She was telling lies he could see. She was saying what she did
not mean to annoy him, for some reason. She was laughing at him. He
was in his old flannel trousers. He had no others. He felt very
rough and isolated and lonely. He knew that she was trying to tease
him for some reason; she didn't want to go to the Lighthouse with
him; she despised him: so did Prue Ramsay; so did they all. But he
was not going to be made a fool of by women, so he turned
deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said,
all in a jerk, very rudely, it would be too rough for her tomorrow.
She would be sick.</p>
<p>It annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that,
with Mrs Ramsay listening. If only he could be alone in his room
working, he thought, among his books. That was where he felt at his
ease. And he had never run a penny into debt; he had never cost his
father a penny since he was fifteen; he had helped them at home out
of his savings; he was educating his sister. Still, he wished he
had known how to answer Miss Briscoe properly; he wished it had not
come out all in a jerk like that. "You'd be sick.” He wished he
could think of something to say to Mrs Ramsay, something which
would show her that he was not just a dry prig. That was what they
all thought him. He turned to her. But Mrs Ramsay was talking about
people he had never heard of to William Bankes.</p>
<p>“Yes, take it away,” she said briefly, interrupting what she was
saying to William Bankes to speak to the maid. "It must have been
fifteen— no, twenty years ago—that I last saw her,” she was saying,
turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of
their talk, for she was absorbed by what they were saying. So he
had actually heard from her this evening! And was Carrie still
living at Marlow, and was everything still the same? Oh, she could
remember it as if it were yesterday—on the river, feeling it as if
it were yesterday—going on the river, feeling very cold. But if the
Mannings made a plan they stuck to it. Never should she forget
Herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank! And it was
still going on, Mrs Ramsay mused, gliding like a ghost among the
chairs and tables of that drawing-room on the banks of the Thames
where she had been so very, very cold twenty years ago; but now she
went among them like a ghost; and it fascinated her, as if, while
she had changed, that particular day, now become very still and
beautiful, had remained there, all these years. Had Carrie written
to him herself? she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. She says they're building a new billiard room,” he said.
No! No! That was out of the question! Building a new billiard room!
It seemed to her impossible.</p>
<p>Mr Bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about
it. They were very well off now. Should he give her love to
Carrie?</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Mrs Ramsay with a little start, "No,” she added,
reflecting that she did not know this Carrie who built a new
billiard room. But how strange, she repeated, to Mr Bankes's
amusement, that they should be going on there still. For it was
extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on
living all these years when she had not thought of them more than
once all that time. How eventful her own life had been, during
those same years. Yet perhaps Carrie Manning had not thought about
her, either. The thought was strange and distasteful.</p>
<p>“People soon drift apart,” said Mr Bankes, feeling, however,
some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the
Mannings and the Ramsays. He had not drifted apart he thought,
laying down his spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips
punctiliously. But perhaps he was rather unusual, he thought, in
this; he never let himself get into a groove. He had friends in all
circles… Mrs Ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid
something about keeping food hot. That was why he preferred dining
alone. All those interruptions annoyed him. Well, thought William
Bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely
spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table-cloth as a
mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in
an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's friends ask
of one. It would have hurt her if he had refused to come. But it
was not worth it for him. Looking at his hand he thought that if he
had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would
have been free to work. Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of
time. The children were dropping in still. "I wish one of you would
run up to Roger's room,” Mrs Ramsay was saying. How trifling it all
is, how boring it all is, he thought, compared with the other
thing— work. Here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth
when he might have been—he took a flashing bird's-eye view of his
work. What a waste of time it all was to be sure! Yet, he thought,
she is one of my oldest friends. I am by way of being devoted to
her. Yet now, at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing
to him: her beauty meant nothing to him; her sitting with her
little boy at the window— nothing, nothing. He wished only to be
alone and to take up that book. He felt uncomfortable; he felt
treacherous, that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for
her. The truth was that he did not enjoy family life. It was in
this sort of state that one asked oneself, What does one live for?
Why, one asked oneself, does one take all these pains for the human
race to go on? Is it so very desirable? Are we attractive as a
species? Not so very, he thought, looking at those rather untidy
boys. His favourite, Cam, was in bed, he supposed. Foolish
questions, vain questions, questions one never asked if one was
occupied. Is human life this? Is human life that? One never had
time to think about it. But here he was asking himself that sort of
question, because Mrs Ramsay was giving orders to servants, and
also because it had struck him, thinking how surprised Mrs Ramsay
was that Carrie Manning should still exist, that friendships, even
the best of them, are frail things. One drifts apart. He reproached
himself again. He was sitting beside Mrs Ramsay and he had nothing
in the world to say to her.</p>
<p>“I'm so sorry,” said Mrs Ramsy, turning to him at last. He felt
rigid and barren, like a pair of boots that have been soaked and
gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them. Yet he
must force his feet into them. He must make himself talk. Unless he
were very careful, she would find out this treachery of his; that
he did not care a straw for her, and that would not be at all
pleasant, he thought. So he bent his head courteously in her
direction.</p>
<p>“How you must detest dining in this bear garden,” she said,
making use, as she did when she was distracted, of her social
manner. So, when there is a strife of tongues, at some meeting, the
chairman, to obtain unity, suggests that every one shall speak in
French. Perhaps it is bad French; French may not contain the words
that express the speaker's thoughts; nevertheless speaking French
imposes some order, some uniformity. Replying to her in the same
language, Mr Bankes said, "No, not at all,” and Mr Tansley, who had
no knowledge of this language, even spoke thus in words of one
syllable, at once suspected its insincerity. They did talk
nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he pounced on this fresh
instance with joy, making a note which, one of these days, he would
read aloud, to one or two friends. There, in a society where one
could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe "staying
with the Ramsays” and what nonsense they talked. It was worth while
doing it once, he would say; but not again. The women bored one so,
he would say. Of course Ramsay had dished himself by marrying a
beautiful woman and having eight children. It would shape itself
something like that, but now, at this moment, sitting stuck there
with an empty seat beside him, nothing had shaped itself at all. It
was all in scraps and fragments. He felt extremely, even
physically, uncomfortable. He wanted somebody to give him a chance
of asserting himself. He wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in
his chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to
break into their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again. They
were talking about the fishing industry. Why did no one ask him his
opinion? What did they know about the fishing industry?</p>
<p>Lily Briscoe knew all that. Sitting opposite him, could she not
see, as in an X-ray photograph, the ribs and thigh bones of the
young man's desire to impress himself, lying dark in the mist of
his flesh—that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning
desire to break into the conversation? But, she thought, screwing
up her Chinese eyes, and remembering how he sneered at women,
"can't paint, can't write,” why should I help him to relieve
himself?</p>
<p>There is a code of behaviour, she knew, whose seventh article
(it may be) says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the
woman, whatever her own occupation might be, to go to the help of
the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh
bones, the ribs, of his vanity, of his urgent desire to assert
himself; as indeed it is their duty, she reflected, in her old
maidenly fairness, to help us, suppose the Tube were to burst into
flames. Then, she thought, I should certainly expect Mr Tansley to
get me out. But how would it be, she thought, if neither of us did
either of these things? So she sat there smiling.</p>
<p>“You're not planning to go to the Lighthouse, are you, Lily,"
said Mrs Ramsay. "Remember poor Mr Langley; he had been round the
world dozens of times, but he told me he never suffered as he did
when my husband took him there. Are you a good sailor, Mr Tansley?"
she asked.</p>
<p>Mr Tansley raised a hammer: swung it high in air; but realising,
as it descended, that he could not smite that butterfly with such
an instrument as this, said only that he had never been sick in his
life. But in that one sentence lay compact, like gunpowder, that
his grandfather was a fisherman; his father a chemist; that he had
worked his way up entirely himself; that he was proud of it; that
he was Charles Tansley—a fact that nobody there seemed to realise;
but one of these days every single person would know it. He scowled
ahead of him. He could almost pity these mild cultivated people,
who would be blown sky high, like bales of wool and barrels of
apples, one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him.</p>
<p>“Will you take me, Mr Tansley?” said Lily, quickly, kindly, for,
of course, if Mrs Ramsay said to her, as in effect she did, "I am
drowning, my dear, in seas of fire. Unless you apply some balm to
the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man
there, life will run upon the rocks—indeed I hear the grating and
the growling at this minute. My nerves are taut as fiddle strings.
Another touch and they will snap"—when Mrs Ramsay said all this, as
the glance in her eyes said it, of course for the hundred and
fiftieth time Lily Briscoe had to renounce the experiment—what
happens if one is not nice to that young man there—and be nice.</p>
<p>Judging the turn in her mood correctly—that she was friendly to
him now—he was relieved of his egotism, and told her how he had
been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby; how his father used
to fish him out with a boat-hook; that was how he had learnt to
swim. One of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off
the Scottish coast, he said. He had been there with him in a storm.
This was said loudly in a pause. They had to listen to him when he
said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm.
Ah, thought Lily Briscoe, as the conversation took this auspicious
turn, and she felt Mrs Ramsay's gratitude (for Mrs Ramsay was free
now to talk for a moment herself), ah, she thought, but what
haven't I paid to get it for you? She had not been sincere.</p>
<p>She had done the usual trick—been nice. She would never know
him. He would never know her. Human relations were all like that,
she thought, and the worst (if it had not been for Mr Bankes) were
between men and women. Inevitably these were extremely insincere
she thought. Then her eye caught the salt cellar, which she had
placed there to remind her, and she remembered that next morning
she would move the tree further towards the middle, and her spirits
rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed
out loud at what Mr Tansley was saying. Let him talk all night if
he liked it.</p>
<p>“But how long do they leave men on a Lighthouse?” she asked. He
told her. He was amazingly well informed. And as he was grateful,
and as he liked her, and as he was beginning to enjoy himself, so
now, Mrs Ramsay thought, she could return to that dream land, that
unreal but fascinating place, the Mannings' drawing-room at Marlow
twenty years ago; where one moved about without haste or anxiety,
for there was no future to worry about. She knew what had happened
to them, what to her. It was like reading a good book again, for
she knew the end of that story, since it had happened twenty years
ago, and life, which shot down even from this dining-room table in
cascades, heaven knows where, was sealed up there, and lay, like a
lake, placidly between its banks. He said they had built a billiard
room—was it possible? Would William go on talking about the
Mannings? She wanted him to. But, no—for some reason he was no
longer in the mood. She tried. He did not respond. She could not
force him. She was disappointed.</p>
<p>“The children are disgraceful,” she said, sighing. He said
something about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we
do not acquire until later in life.</p>
<p>“If at all,” said Mrs Ramsay merely to fill up space, thinking
what an old maid William was becoming. Conscious of his treachery,
conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate, yet
out of mood for it at present, he felt come over him the
disagreeableness of life, sitting there, waiting. Perhaps the
others were saying something interesting? What were they
saying?</p>
<p>That the fishing season was bad; that the men were emigrating.
They were talking about wages and unemployment. The young man was
abusing the government. William Bankes, thinking what a relief it
was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was
disagreeable, heard him say something about "one of the most
scandalous acts of the present government.” Lily was listening; Mrs
Ramsay was listening; they were all listening. But already bored,
Lily felt that something was lacking; Mr Bankes felt that something
was lacking. Pulling her shawl round her Mrs Ramsay felt that
something was lacking. All of them bending themselves to listen
thought, "Pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be
exposed,” for each thought, "The others are feeling this. They are
outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen.
Whereas, I feel nothing at all.” But perhaps, thought Mr Bankes, as
he looked at Mr Tansley, here is the man. One was always waiting
for the man. There was always a chance. At any moment the leader
might arise; the man of genius, in politics as in anything else.
Probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies,
thought Mr Bankes, doing his best to make allowances, for he knew
by some curious physical sensation, as of nerves erect in his
spine, that he was jealous, for himself partly, partly more
probably for his work, for his point of view, for his science; and
therefore he was not entirely open- minded or altogether fair, for
Mr Tansley seemed to be saying, You have wasted your lives. You are
all of you wrong. Poor old fogies, you're hopelessly behind the
times. He seemed to be rather cocksure, this young man; and his
manners were bad. But Mr Bankes bade himself observe, he had
courage; he had ability; he was extremely well up in the facts.
Probably, Mr Bankes thought, as Tansley abused the government,
there is a good deal in what he says.</p>
<p>“Tell me now… ” he said. So they argued about politics, and Lily
looked at the leaf on the table-cloth; and Mrs Ramsay, leaving the
argument entirely in the hands of the two men, wondered why she was
so bored by this talk, and wished, looking at her husband at the
other end of the table, that he would say something. One word, she
said to herself. For if he said a thing, it would make all the
difference. He went to the heart of things. He cared about
fishermen and their wages. He could not sleep for thinking of them.
It was altogether different when he spoke; one did not feel then,
pray heaven you don't see how little I care, because one did care.
Then, realising that it was because she admired him so much that
she was waiting for him to speak, she felt as if somebody had been
praising her husband to her and their marriage, and she glowed all
over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him.
She looked at him thinking to find this in his face; he would be
looking magnificent… But not in the least! He was screwing his face
up, he was scowling and frowning, and flushing with anger. What on
earth was it about? she wondered. What could be the matter? Only
that poor old Augustus had asked for another plate of soup—that was
all. It was unthinkable, it was detestable (so he signalled to her
across the table) that Augustus should be beginning his soup over
again. He loathed people eating when he had finished. She saw his
anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes, his brow, and she
knew that in a moment something violent would explode, and
then—thank goodness! she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on
the wheel, and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not
words. He sat there scowling. He had said nothing, he would have
her observe. Let her give him the credit for that! But why after
all should poor Augustus not ask for another plate of soup? He had
merely touched Ellen's arm and said:</p>
<p>“Ellen, please, another plate of soup,” and then Mr Ramsay
scowled like that.</p>
<p>And why not? Mrs Ramsay demanded. Surely they could let Augustus
have his soup if he wanted it. He hated people wallowing in food,
Mr Ramsay frowned at her. He hated everything dragging on for hours
like this. But he had controlled himself, Mr Ramsay would have her
observe, disgusting though the sight was. But why show it so
plainly, Mrs Ramsay demanded (they looked at each other down the
long table sending these questions and answers across, each knowing
exactly what the other felt). Everybody could see, Mrs Ramsay
thought. There was Rose gazing at her father, there was Roger
gazing at his father; both would be off in spasms of laughter in
another second, she knew, and so she said promptly (indeed it was
time):</p>
<p>“Light the candles,” and they jumped up instantly and went and
fumbled at the sideboard.</p>
<p>Why could he never conceal his feelings? Mrs Ramsay wondered,
and she wondered if Augustus Carmichael had noticed. Perhaps he
had; perhaps he had not. She could not help respecting the
composure with which he sat there, drinking his soup. If he wanted
soup, he asked for soup. Whether people laughed at him or were
angry with him he was the same. He did not like her, she knew that;
but partly for that very reason she respected him, and looking at
him, drinking soup, very large and calm in the failing light, and
monumental, and contemplative, she wondered what he did feel then,
and why he was always content and dignified; and she thought how
devoted he was to Andrew, and would call him into his room, and
Andrew said, "show him things.” And there he would lie all day long
on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry, till he reminded
one of a cat watching birds, and then he clapped his paws together
when he had found the word, and her husband said, "Poor old
Augustus—he's a true poet,” which was high praise from her
husband.</p>
<p>Now eight candles were stood down the table, and after the first
stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility
the long table entire, and in the middle a yellow and purple dish
of fruit. What had she done with it, Mrs Ramsay wondered, for
Rose's arrangement of the grapes and pears, of the horny pink-lined
shell, of the bananas, made her think of a trophy fetched from the
bottom of the sea, of Neptune's banquet, of the bunch that hangs
with vine leaves over the shoulder of Bacchus (in some picture),
among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold…
Thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of
great size and depth, was like a world in which one could take
one's staff and climb hills, she thought, and go down into valleys,
and to her pleasure (for it brought them into sympathy momentarily)
she saw that Augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of
fruit, plunged in, broke off a bloom there, a tassel here, and
returned, after feasting, to his hive. That was his way of looking,
different from hers. But looking together united them.</p>
<p>Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of
the table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as
they had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for
the night was now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from
giving any accurate view of the outside world, rippled it so
strangely that here, inside the room, seemed to be order and dry
land; there, outside, a reflection in which things waved and
vanished, waterily.</p>
<p>Some change at once went through them all, as if this had really
happened, and they were all conscious of making a party together in
a hollow, on an island; had their common cause against that
fluidity out there. Mrs Ramsay, who had been uneasy, waiting for
Paul and Minta to come in, and unable, she felt, to settle to
things, now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation. For now
they must come, and Lily Briscoe, trying to analyse the cause of
the sudden exhilaration, compared it with that moment on the tennis
lawn, when solidity suddenly vanished, and such vast spaces lay
between them; and now the same effect was got by the many candles
in the sparely furnished room, and the uncurtained windows, and the
bright mask-like look of faces seen by candlelight. Some weight was
taken off them; anything might happen, she felt. They must come
now, Mrs Ramsay thought, looking at the door, and at that instant,
Minta Doyle, Paul Rayley, and a maid carrying a great dish in her
hands came in together. They were awfully late; they were horribly
late, Minta said, as they found their way to different ends of the
table.</p>
<p>“I lost my brooch—my grandmother's brooch,” said Minta with a
sound of lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large
brown eyes, looking down, looking up, as she sat by Mr Ramsay,
which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her.</p>
<p>How could she be such a goose, he asked, as to scramble about
the rocks in jewels?</p>
<p>She was by way of being terrified of him—he was so fearfully
clever, and the first night when she had sat by him, and he talked
about George Eliot, she had been really frightened, for she had
left the third volume of MIDDLEMARCH in the train and she never
knew what happened in the end; but afterwards she got on perfectly,
and made herself out even more ignorant than she was, because he
liked telling her she was a fool. And so tonight, directly he
laughed at her, she was not frightened. Besides, she knew, directly
she came into the room that the miracle had happened; she wore her
golden haze. Sometimes she had it; sometimes not. She never knew
why it came or why it went, or if she had it until she came into
the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at
her. Yes, tonight she had it, tremendously; she knew that by the
way Mr Ramsay told her not to be a fool. She sat beside him,
smiling.</p>
<p>It must have happened then, thought Mrs Ramsay; they are
engaged. And for a moment she felt what she had never expected to
feel again— jealousy. For he, her husband, felt it too—Minta's
glow; he liked these girls, these golden-reddish girls, with
something flying, something a little wild and harum-scarum about
them, who didn't "scrape their hair off,” weren't, as he said about
poor Lily Briscoe, "skimpy". There was some quality which she
herself had not, some lustre, some richness, which attracted him,
amused him, led him to make favourites of girls like Minta. They
might cut his hair from him, plait him watch-chains, or interrupt
him at his work, hailing him (she heard them), "Come along, Mr
Ramsay; it's our turn to beat them now,” and out he came to play
tennis.</p>
<p>But indeed she was not jealous, only, now and then, when she
made herself look in her glass, a little resentful that she had
grown old, perhaps, by her own fault. (The bill for the greenhouse
and all the rest of it.) She was grateful to them for laughing at
him. ("How many pipes have you smoked today, Mr Ramsay?” and so
on), till he seemed a young man; a man very attractive to women,
not burdened, not weighed down with the greatness of his labours
and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure, but again
as she had first known him, gaunt but gallant; helping her out of a
boat, she remembered; with delightful ways, like that (she looked
at him, and he looked astonishingly young, teasing Minta). For
herself—"Put it down there,” she said, helping the Swiss girl to
place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the BOEUF
EN DAUBE—for her own part, she liked her boobies. Paul must sit by
her. She had kept a place for him. Really, she sometimes thought
she liked the boobies best. They did not bother one with their
dissertations. How much they missed, after all, these very clever
men! How dried up they did become, to be sure. There was something,
she thought as he sat down, very charming about Paul. His manners
were delightful to her, and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue
eyes. He was so considerate. Would he tell her—now that they were
all talking again—what had happened?</p>
<p>“We went back to look for Minta's brooch,” he said, sitting down
by her. "We"—that was enough. She knew from the effort, the rise in
his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time
he had said "we.” "We did this, we did that.” They'll say that all
their lives, she thought, and an exquisite scent of olives and oil
and juice rose from the great brown dish as Marthe, with a little
flourish, took the cover off. The cook had spent three days over
that dish. And she must take great care, Mrs Ramsay thought, diving
into the soft mass, to choose a specially tender piece for William
Bankes. And she peered into the dish, with its shiny walls and its
confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and
its wine, and thought, This will celebrate the occasion—a curious
sense rising in her, at once freakish and tender, of celebrating a
festival, as if two emotions were called up in her, one
profound—for what could be more serious than the love of man for
woman, what more commanding, more impressive, bearing in its bosom
the seeds of death; at the same time these lovers, these people
entering into illusion glittering eyed, must be danced round with
mockery, decorated with garlands.</p>
<p>“It is a triumph,” said Mr Bankes, laying his knife down for a
moment. He had eaten attentively. It was rich; it was tender. It
was perfectly cooked. How did she manage these things in the depths
of the country? he asked her. She was a wonderful woman. All his
love, all his reverence, had returned; and she knew it.</p>
<p>“It is a French recipe of my grandmother's,” said Mrs Ramsay,
speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice. Of course it
was French. What passes for cookery in England is an abomination
(they agreed). It is putting cabbages in water. It is roasting meat
till it is like leather. It is cutting off the delicious skins of
vegetables. "In which,” said Mr Bankes, "all the virtue of the
vegetable is contained.” And the waste, said Mrs Ramsay. A whole
French family could live on what an English cook throws away.
Spurred on by her sense that William's affection had come back to
her, and that everything was all right again, and that her suspense
was over, and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock,
she laughed, she gesticulated, till Lily thought, How childlike,
how absurd she was, sitting up there with all her beauty opened
again in her, talking about the skins of vegetables. There was
something frightening about her. She was irresistible. Always she
got her own way in the end, Lily thought. Now she had brought this
off—Paul and Minta, one might suppose, were engaged. Mr Bankes was
dining here. She put a spell on them all, by wishing, so simply, so
directly, and Lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty
of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her
face was all lit up—without looking young, she looked radiant) in
this strange, this terrifying thing, which made Paul Rayley,
sitting at her side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed,
silent. Mrs Ramsay, Lily felt, as she talked about the skins of
vegetables, exalted that, worshipped that; held her hands over it
to warm them, to protect it, and yet, having brought it all about,
somehow laughed, led her victims, Lily felt, to the altar. It came
over her too now—the emotion, the vibration, of love. How
inconspicuous she felt herself by Paul's side! He, glowing,
burning; she, aloof, satirical; he, bound for adventure; she,
moored to the shore; he, launched, incautious; she solitary, left
out—and, ready to implore a share, if it were a disaster, in his
disaster, she said shyly:</p>
<p>“When did Minta lose her brooch?”</p>
<p>He smiled the most exquisite smile, veiled by memory, tinged by
dreams. He shook his head. "On the beach,” he said.</p>
<p>“I'm going to find it,” he said, "I'm getting up early.” This
being kept secret from Minta, he lowered his voice, and turned his
eyes to where she sat, laughing, beside Mr Ramsay.</p>
<p>Lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to
help him, envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the
one to pounce on the brooch half-hidden by some stone, and thus
herself be included among the sailors and adventurers. But what did
he reply to her offer? She actually said with an emotion that she
seldom let appear, "Let me come with you,” and he laughed. He meant
yes or no— either perhaps. But it was not his meaning—it was the
odd chuckle he gave, as if he had said, Throw yourself over the
cliff if you like, I don't care. He turned on her cheek the heat of
love, its horror, its cruelty, its unscrupulosity. It scorched her,
and Lily, looking at Minta, being charming to Mr Ramsay at the
other end of the table, flinched for her exposed to these fangs,
and was thankful. For at any rate, she said to herself, catching
sight of the salt cellar on the pattern, she need not marry, thank
Heaven: she need not undergo that degradation. She was saved from
that dilution. She would move the tree rather more to the
middle.</p>
<p>Such was the complexity of things. For what happened to her,
especially staying with the Ramsays, was to be made to feel
violently two opposite things at the same time; that's what you
feel, was one; that's what I feel, was the other, and then they
fought together in her mind, as now. It is so beautiful, so
exciting, this love, that I tremble on the verge of it, and offer,
quite out of my own habit, to look for a brooch on a beach; also it
is the stupidest, the most barbaric of human passions, and turns a
nice young man with a profile like a gem's (Paul's was exquisite)
into a bully with a crowbar (he was swaggering, he was insolent) in
the Mile End Road. Yet, she said to herself, from the dawn of time
odes have been sung to love; wreaths heaped and roses; and if you
asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but
this—love; while the women, judging from her own experience, would
all the time be feeling, This is not what we want; there is nothing
more tedious, puerile, and inhumane than this; yet it is also
beautiful and necessary. Well then, well then? she asked, somehow
expecting the others to go on with the argument, as if in an
argument like this one threw one's own little bolt which fell short
obviously and left the others to carry it on. So she listened again
to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon
the question of love.</p>
<p>“Then,” said Mr Bankes, "there is that liquid the English call
coffee.”</p>
<p>“Oh, coffee!” said Mrs Ramsay. But it was much rather a question
(she was thoroughly roused, Lily could see, and talked very
emphatically) of real butter and clean milk. Speaking with warmth
and eloquence, she described the iniquity of the English dairy
system, and in what state milk was delivered at the door, and was
about to prove her charges, for she had gone into the matter, when
all round the table, beginning with Andrew in the middle, like a
fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze, her children laughed; her
husband laughed; she was laughed at, fire- encircled, and forced to
veil her crest, dismount her batteries, and only retaliate by
displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table to Mr Bankes as
an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of
the British Public.</p>
<p>Purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that Lily, who
had helped her with Mr Tansley, was out of things, she exempted her
from the rest; said "Lily anyhow agrees with me,” and so drew her
in, a little fluttered, a little startled. (For she was thinking
about love.) They were both out of things, Mrs Ramsay had been
thinking, both Lily and Charles Tansley. Both suffered from the
glow of the other two. He, it was clear, felt himself utterly in
the cold; no woman would look at him with Paul Rayley in the room.
Poor fellow! Still, he had his dissertation, the influence of
somebody upon something: he could take care of himself. With Lily
it was different. She faded, under Minta's glow; became more
inconspicuous than ever, in her little grey dress with her little
puckered face and her little Chinese eyes. Everything about her was
so small. Yet, thought Mrs Ramsay, comparing her with Minta, as she
claimed her help (for Lily should bear her out she talked no more
about her dairies than her husband did about his boots—he would
talk by the hour about his boots) of the two, Lily at forty will be
the better. There was in Lily a thread of something; a flare of
something; something of her own which Mrs Ramsay liked very much
indeed, but no man would, she feared. Obviously, not, unless it
were a much older man, like William Bankes. But then he cared,
well, Mrs Ramsay sometimes thought that he cared, since his wife's
death, perhaps for her. He was not "in love” of course; it was one
of those unclassified affections of which there are so many. Oh,
but nonsense, she thought; William must marry Lily. They have so
many things in common. Lily is so fond of flowers. They are both
cold and aloof and rather self-sufficing. She must arrange for them
to take a long walk together.</p>
<p>Foolishly, she had set them opposite each other. That could be
remedied tomorrow. If it were fine, they should go for a picnic.
Everything seemed possible. Everything seemed right. Just now (but
this cannot last, she thought, dissociating herself from the moment
while they were all talking about boots) just now she had reached
security; she hovered like a hawk suspended; like a flag floated in
an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and
sweetly, not noisily, solemnly rather, for it arose, she thought,
looking at them all eating there, from husband and children and
friends; all of which rising in this profound stillness (she was
helping William Bankes to one very small piece more, and peered
into the depths of the earthenware pot) seemed now for no special
reason to stay there like a smoke, like a fume rising upwards,
holding them safe together. Nothing need be said; nothing could be
said. There it was, all round them. It partook, she felt, carefully
helping Mr Bankes to a specially tender piece, of eternity; as she
had already felt about something different once before that
afternoon; there is a coherence in things, a stability; something,
she meant, is immune from change, and shines out (she glanced at
the window with its ripple of reflected lights) in the face of the
flowing, the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby; so that again
tonight she had the feeling she had had once today, already, of
peace, of rest. Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made
that endures.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she assured William Bankes, "there is plenty for
everybody.”</p>
<p>“Andrew,” she said, "hold your plate lower, or I shall spill
it.” (The BOEUF EN DAUBE was a perfect triumph.) Here, she felt,
putting the spoon down, where one could move or rest; could wait
now (they were all helped) listening; could then, like a hawk which
lapses suddenly from its high station, flaunt and sink on laughter
easily, resting her whole weight upon what at the other end of the
table her husband was saying about the square root of one thousand
two hundred and fifty-three. That was the number, it seemed, on his
watch.</p>
<p>What did it all mean? To this day she had no notion. A square
root? What was that? Her sons knew. She leant on them; on cubes and
square roots; that was what they were talking about now; on
Voltaire and Madame de Stael; on the character of Napoleon; on the
French system of land tenure; on Lord Rosebery; on Creevey's
Memoirs: she let it uphold her and sustain her, this admirable
fabric of the masculine intelligence, which ran up and down,
crossed this way and that, like iron girders spanning the swaying
fabric, upholding the world, so that she could trust herself to it
utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker them for a moment, as a
child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the
leaves of a tree. Then she woke up. It was still being fabricated.
William Bankes was praising the Waverly novels.</p>
<p>He read one of them every six months, he said. And why should
that make Charles Tansley angry? He rushed in (all, thought Mrs
Ramsay, because Prue will not be nice to him) and denounced the
Waverly novels when he knew nothing about it, nothing about it
whatsoever, Mrs Ramsay thought, observing him rather than listening
to what he said. She could see how it was from his manner—he wanted
to assert himself, and so it would always be with him till he got
his Professorship or married his wife, and so need not be always
saying, "I—I—I.” For that was what his criticism of poor Sir
Walter, or perhaps it was Jane Austen, amounted to. "I—I—I.” He was
thinking of himself and the impression he was making, as she could
tell by the sound of his voice, and his emphasis and his
uneasiness. Success would be good for him. At any rate they were
off again. Now she need not listen. It could not last, she knew,
but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go
round the table unveiling each of these people, and their thoughts
and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under
water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows
balancing themselves, and the sudden silent trout are all lit up
hanging, trembling. So she saw them; she heard them; but whatever
they said had also this quality, as if what they said was like the
movement of a trout when, at the same time, one can see the ripple
and the gravel, something to the right, something to the left; and
the whole is held together; for whereas in active life she would be
netting and separating one thing from another; she would be saying
she liked the Waverly novels or had not read them; she would be
urging herself forward; now she said nothing. For the moment, she
hung suspended.</p>
<p>“Ah, but how long do you think it'll last?” said somebody. It
was as if she had antennae trembling out from her, which,
intercepting certain sentences, forced them upon her attention.
This was one of them. She scented danger for her husband. A
question like that would lead, almost certainly, to something being
said which reminded him of his own failure. How long would he be
read—he would think at once. William Bankes (who was entirely free
from all such vanity) laughed, and said he attached no importance
to changes in fashion. Who could tell what was going to last—in
literature or indeed in anything else?</p>
<p>“Let us enjoy what we do enjoy,” he said. His integrity seemed
to Mrs Ramsay quite admirable. He never seemed for a moment to
think, But how does this affect me? But then if you had the other
temperament, which must have praise, which must have encouragement,
naturally you began (and she knew that Mr Ramsay was beginning) to
be uneasy; to want somebody to say, Oh, but your work will last, Mr
Ramsay, or something like that. He showed his uneasiness quite
clearly now by saying, with some irritation, that, anyhow, Scott
(or was it Shakespeare&#160;?) would last him his lifetime. He said
it irritably. Everybody, she thought, felt a little uncomfortable,
without knowing why. Then Minta Doyle, whose instinct was fine,
said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not believe that any one
really enjoyed reading Shakespeare. Mr Ramsay said grimly (but his
mind was turned away again) that very few people liked it as much
as they said they did. But, he added, there is considerable merit
in some of the plays nevertheless, and Mrs Ramsay saw that it would
be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at Minta, and
she, Mrs Ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about himself,
would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and praise
him, somehow or other. But she wished it was not necessary: perhaps
it was her fault that it was necessary. Anyhow, she was free now to
listen to what Paul Rayley was trying to say about books one had
read as a boy. They lasted, he said. He had read some of Tolstoi at
school. There was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten
the name. Russian names were impossible, said Mrs Ramsay.
"Vronsky,” said Paul. He remembered that because he always thought
it such a good name for a villain. "Vronsky,” said Mrs Ramsay; "Oh,
ANNA KARENINA,” but that did not take them very far; books were not
in their line. No, Charles Tansley would put them both right in a
second about books, but it was all so mixed up with, Am I saying
the right thing? Am I making a good impression? that, after all,
one knew more about him than about Tolstoi, whereas, what Paul said
was about the thing, simply, not himself, nothing else. Like all
stupid people, he had a kind of modesty too, a consideration for
what you were feeling, which, once in a way at least, she found
attractive. Now he was thinking, not about himself, or about
Tolstoi, but whether she was cold, whether she felt a draught,
whether she would like a pear.</p>
<p>No, she said, she did not want a pear. Indeed she had been
keeping guard over the dish of fruit (without realising it)
jealously, hoping that nobody would touch it. Her eyes had been
going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit, among
the rich purples of the lowland grapes, then over the horny ridge
of the shell, putting a yellow against a purple, a curved shape
against a round shape, without knowing why she did it, or why,
every time she did it, she felt more and more serene; until, oh,
what a pity that they should do it—a hand reached out, took a pear,
and spoilt the whole thing. In sympathy she looked at Rose. She
looked at Rose sitting between Jasper and Prue. How odd that one's
child should do that!</p>
<p>How odd to see them sitting there, in a row, her children,
Jasper, Rose, Prue, Andrew, almost silent, but with some joke of
their own going on, she guessed, from the twitching at their lips.
It was something quite apart from everything else, something they
were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room. It was not about
their father, she hoped. No, she thought not. What was it, she
wondered, sadly rather, for it seemed to her that they would laugh
when she was not there. There was all that hoarded behind those
rather set, still, mask-like faces, for they did not join in
easily; they were like watchers, surveyors, a little raised or set
apart from the grown-up people. But when she looked at Prue
tonight, she saw that this was not now quite true of her. She was
just beginning, just moving, just descending. The faintest light
was on her face, as if the glow of Minta opposite, some excitement,
some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her, as if the sun
of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table-cloth,
and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it.
She kept looking at Minta, shyly, yet curiously, so that Mrs Ramsay
looked from one to the other and said, speaking to Prue in her own
mind, You will be as happy as she is one of these days. You will be
much happier, she added, because you are my daughter, she meant;
her own daughter must be happier than other people's daughters. But
dinner was over. It was time to go. They were only playing with
things on their plates. She would wait until they had done laughing
at some story her husband was telling. He was having a joke with
Minta about a bet. Then she would get up.</p>
<p>She liked Charles Tansley, she thought, suddenly; she liked his
laugh. She liked him for being so angry with Paul and Minta. She
liked his awkwardness. There was a lot in that young man after all.
And Lily, she thought, putting her napkin beside her plate, she
always has some joke of her own. One need never bother about Lily.
She waited. She tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate.
Well, were they done now? No. That story had led to another story.
Her husband was in great spirits tonight, and wishing, she
supposed, to make it all right with old Augustus after that scene
about the soup, had drawn him in— they were telling stories about
some one they had both known at college. She looked at the window
in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were
black, and looking at that outside the voices came to her very
strangely, as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral, for
she did not listen to the words. The sudden bursts of laughter and
then one voice (Minta's) speaking alone, reminded her of men and
boys crying out the Latin words of a service in some Roman Catholic
cathedral. She waited. Her husband spoke. He was repeating
something, and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring
of exultation, and melancholy in his voice:</p>
<p>Come out and climb the garden path, Luriana Lurilee. The China
rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee.</p>
<p>The words (she was looking at the window) sounded as if they
were floating like flowers on water out there, cut off from them
all, as if no one had said them, but they had come into existence
of themselves.</p>
<p>And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be Are full
of trees and changing leaves.</p>
<p>She did not know what they meant, but, like music, the words
seemed to be spoken by her own voice, outside her self, saying
quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole
evening while she said different things. She knew, without looking
round, that every one at the table was listening to the voice
saying:</p>
<p>I wonder if it seems to you, Luriana, Lurilee</p>
<p>with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had, as if
this were, at last, the natural thing to say, this were their own
voice speaking.</p>
<p>But the voice had stopped. She looked round. She made herself
get up. Augustus Carmichael had risen and, holding his table napkin
so that it looked like a long white robe he stood chanting:</p>
<p>To see the Kings go riding by Over lawn and daisy lea With their
palm leaves and cedar Luriana, Lurilee,</p>
<p>and as she passed him, he turned slightly towards her repeating
the last words:</p>
<p>Luriana, Lurilee</p>
<p>and bowed to her as if he did her homage. Without knowing why,
she felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before; and
with a feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and
passed through the door which he held open for her.</p>
<p>It was necessary now to carry everything a step further. With
her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene
which was vanishing even as she looked, and then, as she moved and
took Minta's arm and left the room, it changed, it shaped itself
differently; it had become, she knew, giving one last look at it
over her shoulder, already the past.</p>
