<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
</div>


<p>The house was left; the house was deserted. It was left like a
shell on a sandhill to fill with dry salt grains now that life had
left it. The long night seemed to have set in; the trifling airs,
nibbling, the clammy breaths, fumbling, seemed to have triumphed.
The saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed. Toads had nosed their
way in. Idly, aimlessly, the swaying shawl swung to and fro. A
thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder. The swallows
nested in the drawing- roon; the floor was strewn with straw; the
plaster fell in shovelfuls; rafters were laid bare; rats carried
off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots. Tortoise-shell
butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on
the window-pane. Poppies sowed themselves among the dahlias; the
lawn waved with long grass; giant artichokes towered among roses; a
fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages; while the gentle
tapping of a weed at the window had become, on winters' nights, a
drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which made the whole
room green in summer.</p>
<p>What power could now prevent the fertility, the insensibility of
nature? Mrs McNab's dream of a lady, of a child, of a plate of milk
soup? It had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and
vanished. She had locked the door; she had gone. It was beyond the
strength of one woman, she said. They never sent. They never wrote.
There were things up there rotting in the drawers—it was a shame to
leave them so, she said. The place was gone to rack and ruin. Only
the Lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden
stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter, looked with
equanimity at the thistle and the swallow, the rat and the straw.
Nothing now withstood them; nothing said no to them. Let the wind
blow; let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the
cabbage. Let the swallow build in the drawing-room, and the thistle
thrust aside the tiles, and the butterfly sun itself on the faded
chintz of the arm-chairs. Let the broken glass and the china lie
out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild
berries.</p>
<p>For now had come that moment, that hesitation when dawn trembles
and night pauses, when if a feather alight in the scale it will be
weighed down. One feather, and the house, sinking, falling, would
have turned and pitched downwards to the depths of darkness. In the
ruined room, picnickers would have lit their kettles; lovers sought
shelter there, lying on the bare boards; and the shepherd stored
his dinner on the bricks, and the tramp slept with his coat round
him to ward off the cold. Then the roof would have fallen; briars
and hemlocks would have blotted out path, step and window; would
have grown, unequally but lustily over the mound, until some
trespasser, losing his way, could have told only by a red-hot poker
among the nettles, or a scrap of china in the hemlock, that here
once some one had lived; there had been a house.</p>
<p>If the feather had fallen, if it had tipped the scale downwards,
the whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the
sands of oblivion. But there was a force working; something not
highly conscious; something that leered, something that lurched;
something not inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual
or solemn chanting. Mrs McNab groaned; Mrs Bast creaked. They were
old; they were stiff; their legs ached. They came with their brooms
and pails at last; they got to work. All of a sudden, would Mrs
McNab see that the house was ready, one of the young ladies wrote:
would she get this done; would she get that done; all in a hurry.
They might be coming for the summer; had left everything to the
last; expected to find things as they had left them. Slowly and
painfully, with broom and pail, mopping, scouring, Mrs McNab, Mrs
Bast, stayed the corruption and the rot; rescued from the pool of
Time that was fast closing over them now a basin, now a cupboard;
fetched up from oblivion all the Waverley novels and a tea-set one
morning; in the afternoon restored to sun and air a brass fender
and a set of steel fire-irons. George, Mrs Bast's son, caught the
rats, and cut the grass. They had the builders. Attended with the
creaking of hinges and the screeching of bolts, the slamming and
banging of damp-swollen woodwork, some rusty laborious birth seemed
to be taking place, as the women, stooping, rising, groaning,
singing, slapped and slammed, upstairs now, now down in the
cellars. Oh, they said, the work!</p>
<p>They drank their tea in the bedroom sometimes, or in the study;
breaking off work at mid-day with the smudge on their faces, and
their old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles. Flopped
on chairs, they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps
and bath; now the more arduous, more partial triumph over long rows
of books, black as ravens once, now white-stained, breeding pale
mushrooms and secreting furtive spiders. Once more, as she felt the
tea warm in her, the telescope fitted itself to Mrs McNab's eyes,
and in a ring of light she saw the old gentleman, lean as a rake,
wagging his head, as she came up with the washing, talking to
himself, she supposed, on the lawn. He never noticed her. Some said
he was dead; some said she was dead. Which was it? Mrs Bast didn't
know for certain either. The young gentleman was dead. That she was
sure. She had read his name in the papers.</p>
<p>There was the cook now, Mildred, Marian, some such name as
that—a red- headed woman, quick-tempered like all her sort, but
kind, too, if you knew the way with her. Many a laugh they had had
together. She saved a plate of soup for Maggie; a bite of ham,
sometimes; whatever was over. They lived well in those days. They
had everything they wanted (glibly, jovially, with the tea hot in
her, she unwound her ball of memories, sitting in the wicker
arm-chair by the nursery fender). There was always plenty doing,
people in the house, twenty staying sometimes, and washing up till
long past midnight.</p>
<p>Mrs Bast (she had never known them; had lived in Glasgow at that
time) wondered, putting her cup down, whatever they hung that
beast's skull there for? Shot in foreign parts no doubt.</p>
<p>It might well be, said Mrs McNab, wantoning on with her
memories; they had friends in eastern countries; gentlemen staying
there, ladies in evening dress; she had seen them once through the
dining-room door all sitting at dinner. Twenty she dared say all in
their jewellery, and she asked to stay help wash up, might be till
after midnight.</p>
<p>Ah, said Mrs Bast, they'd find it changed. She leant out of the
window. She watched her son George scything the grass. They might
well ask, what had been done to it? seeing how old Kennedy was
supposed to have charge of it, and then his leg got so bad after he
fell from the cart; and perhaps then no one for a year, or the
better part of one; and then Davie Macdonald, and seeds might be
sent, but who should say if they were ever planted? They'd find it
changed.</p>
<p>She watched her son scything. He was a great one for work—one of
those quiet ones. Well they must be getting along with the
cupboards, she supposed. They hauled themselves up.</p>
<p>At last, after days of labour within, of cutting and digging
without, dusters were flicked from the windows, the windows were
shut to, keys were turned all over the house; the front door was
banged; it was finished.</p>
<p>And now as if the cleaning and the scrubbing and the scything
and the mowing had drowned it there rose that half-heard melody,
that intermittent music which the ear half catches but lets fall; a
bark, a bleat; irregular, intermittent, yet somehow related; the
hum of an insect, the tremor of cut grass, disevered yet somehow
belonging; the jar of a dorbeetle, the squeak of a wheel, loud,
low, but mysteriously related; which the ear strains to bring
together and is always on the verge of harmonising, but they are
never quite heard, never fully harmonised, and at last, in the
evening, one after another the sounds die out, and the harmony
falters, and silence falls. With the sunset sharpness was lost, and
like mist rising, quiet rose, quiet spread, the wind settled;
loosely the world shook itself down to sleep, darkly here without a
light to it, save what came green suffused through leaves, or pale
on the white flowers in the bed by the window.</p>
<p>[Lily Briscoe had her bag carried up to the house late one
evening in September. Mr Carmichael came by the same train.]</p>
