<h1>Chapter 16</h1>
</div>


<p>Well then, Nancy had gone with them, Mrs Ramsay supposed,
wondering, as she put down a brush, took up a comb, and said "Come
in” to a tap at the door (Jasper and Rose came in), whether the
fact that Nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely
that anything would happen; it made it less likely, somehow, Mrs
Ramsay felt, very irrationally, except that after all holocaust on
such a scale was not probable. They could not all be drowned. And
again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist,
life.</p>
<p>Jasper and Rose said that Mildred wanted to know whether she
should wait dinner.</p>
<p>“Not for the Queen of England,” said Mrs Ramsay
emphatically.</p>
<p>“Not for the Empress of Mexico,” she added, laughing at Jasper;
for he shared his mother's vice: he, too, exaggerated.</p>
<p>And if Rose liked, she said, while Jasper took the message, she
might choose which jewels she was to wear. When there are fifteen
people sitting down to dinner, one cannot keep things waiting for
ever. She was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so
late; it was inconsiderate of them, and it annoyed her on top of
her anxiety about them, that they should choose this very night to
be out late, when, in fact, she wished the dinner to be
particularly nice, since William Bankes had at last consented to
dine with them; and they were having Mildred's masterpiece—BOEUF EN
DAUBE. Everything depended upon things being served up to the
precise moment they were ready. The beef, the bayleaf, and the
wine—all must be done to a turn. To keep it waiting was out of the
question. Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out they went, and
they came in late, and things had to be sent out, things had to be
kept hot; the BOEUF EN DAUBE would be entirely spoilt.</p>
<p>Jasper offered her an opal necklace; Rose a gold necklace. Which
looked best against her black dress? Which did indeed, said Mrs
Ramsay absent-mindedly, looking at her neck and shoulders (but
avoiding her face) in the glass. And then, while the children
rummaged among her things, she looked out of the window at a sight
which always amused her—the rooks trying to decide which tree to
settle on. Every time, they seemed to change their minds and rose
up into the air again, because, she thought, the old rook, the
father rook, old Joseph was her name for him, was a bird of a very
trying and difficult disposition. He was a disreputable old bird,
with half his wing feathers missing. He was like some seedy old
gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a
public house.</p>
<p>“Look!” she said, laughing. They were actually fighting. Joseph
and Mary were fighting. Anyhow they all went up again, and the air
was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite
scimitar shapes. The movements of the wings beating out, out,
out—she could never describe it accurately enough to please
herself—was one of the loveliest of all to her. Look at that, she
said to Rose, hoping that Rose would see it more clearly than she
could. For one's children so often gave one's own perceptions a
little thrust forwards.</p>
<p>But which was it to be? They had all the trays of her jewel-case
open. The gold necklace, which was Italian, or the opal necklace,
which Uncle James had brought her from India; or should she wear
her amethysts?</p>
<p>“Choose, dearests, choose,” she said, hoping that they would
make haste.</p>
<p>But she let them take their time to choose: she let Rose,
particularly, take up this and then that, and hold her jewels
against the black dress, for this little ceremony of choosing
jewels, which was gone through every night, was what Rose liked
best, she knew. She had some hidden reason of her own for attaching
great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear. What
was the reason, Mrs Ramsay wondered, standing still to let her
clasp the necklace she had chosen, divining, through her own past,
some deep, some buried, some quite speechless feeling that one had
for one's mother at Rose's age. Like all feelings felt for oneself,
Mrs Ramsay thought, it made one sad. It was so inadequate, what one
could give in return; and what Rose felt was quite out of
proportion to anything she actually was. And Rose would grow up;
and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep feelings, and
she said she was ready now, and they would go down, and Jasper,
because he was the gentleman, should give her his arm, and Rose, as
she was the lady, should carry her handkerchief (she gave her the
handkerchief), and what else? oh, yes, it might be cold: a shawl.
Choose me a shawl, she said, for that would please Rose, who was
bound to suffer so. "There,” she said, stopping by the window on
the landing, "there they are again.” Joseph had settled on another
tree- top. "Don't you think they mind,” she said to Jasper, "having
their wings broken?” Why did he want to shoot poor old Joseph and
Mary? He shuffled a little on the stairs, and felt rebuked, but not
seriously, for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds;
and they did not feel; and being his mother she lived away in
another division of the world, but he rather liked her stories
about Mary and Joseph. She made him laugh. But how did she know
that those were Mary and Joseph? Did she think the same birds came
to the same trees every night? he asked. But here, suddenly, like
all grown-up people, she ceased to pay him the least attention. She
was listening to a clatter in the hall.</p>
<p>“They've come back!” she exclaimed, and at once she felt much
more annoyed with them than relieved. Then she wondered, had it
happened? She would go down and they would tell her—but no. They
could not tell her anything, with all these people about. So she
must go down and begin dinner and wait. And, like some queen who,
finding her people gathered in the hall, looks down upon them, and
descends among them, and acknowledges their tributes silently, and
accepts their devotion and their prostration before her (Paul did
not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed) she
went down, and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly,
as if she accepted what they could not say: their tribute to her
beauty.</p>
<p>But she stopped. There was a smell of burning. Could they have
let the BOEUF EN DAUBE overboil? she wondered, pray heaven not!
when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly,
authoritatively, that all those scattered about, in attics, in
bedrooms, on little perches of their own, reading, writing, putting
the last smooth to their hair, or fastening dresses, must leave all
that, and the little odds and ends on their washing-tables and
dressing tables, and the novels on the bed- tables, and the diaries
which were so private, and assemble in the dining-room for
dinner.</p>
