<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p>So with the house empty and the doors locked and the mattresses
rolled round, those stray airs, advance guards of great armies,
blustered in, brushed bare boards, nibbled and fanned, met nothing
in bedroom or drawing-room that wholly resisted them but only
hangings that flapped, wood that creaked, the bare legs of tables,
saucepans and china already furred, tarnished, cracked. What people
had shed and left—a pair of shoes, a shooting cap, some faded
skirts and coats in wardrobes—those alone kept the human shape and
in the emptiness indicated how once they were filled and animated;
how once hands were busy with hooks and buttons; how once the
looking-glass had held a face; had held a world hollowed out in
which a figure turned, a hand flashed, the door opened, in came
children rushing and tumbling; and went out again. Now, day after
day, light turned, like a flower reflected in water, its sharp
image on the wall opposite. Only the shadows of the trees,
flourishing in the wind, made obeisance on the wall, and for a
moment darkened the pool in which light reflected itself; or birds,
flying, made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom
floor.</p>
<p>So loveliness reigned and stillness, and together made the shape
of loveliness itself, a form from which life had parted; solitary
like a pool at evening, far distant, seen from a train window,
vanishing so quickly that the pool, pale in the evening, is
scarcely robbed of its solitude, though once seen. Loveliness and
stillness clasped hands in the bedroom, and among the shrouded jugs
and sheeted chairs even the prying of the wind, and the soft nose
of the clammy sea airs, rubbing, snuffling, iterating, and
reiterating their questions—"Will you fade? Will you
perish?"—scarcely disturbed the peace, the indifference, the air of
pure integrity, as if the question they asked scarcely needed that
they should answer: we remain.</p>
<p>Nothing it seemed could break that image, corrupt that
innocence, or disturb the swaying mantle of silence which, week
after week, in the empty room, wove into itself the falling cries
of birds, ships hooting, the drone and hum of the fields, a dog's
bark, a man's shout, and folded them round the house in silence.
Once only a board sprang on the landing; once in the middle of the
night with a roar, with a rupture, as after centuries of
quiescence, a rock rends itself from the mountain and hurtles
crashing into the valley, one fold of the shawl loosened and swung
to and fro. Then again peace descended; and the shadow wavered;
light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom wall; and
Mrs McNab, tearing the veil of silence with hands that had stood in
the wash-tub, grinding it with boots that had crunched the shingle,
came as directed to open all windows, and dust the bedrooms.</p>
