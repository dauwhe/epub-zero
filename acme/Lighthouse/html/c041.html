<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<p>It was like that then, the island, thought Cam, once more
drawing her fingers through the waves. She had never seen it from
out at sea before. It lay like that on the sea, did it, with a dent
in the middle and two sharp crags, and the sea swept in there, and
spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island. It
was very small; shaped something like a leaf stood on end. So we
took a little boat, she thought, beginning to tell herself a story
of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship. But with the sea
streaming through her fingers, a spray of seaweed vanishing behind
them, she did not want to tell herself seriously a story; it was
the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted, for she was
thinking, as the boat sailed on, how her father's anger about the
points of the compass, James's obstinacy about the compact, and her
own anguish, all had slipped, all had passed, all had streamed
away. What then came next? Where were they going? From her hand,
ice cold, held deep in the sea, there spurted up a fountain of joy
at the change, at the escape, at the adventure (that she should be
alive, that she should be there). And the drops falling from this
sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the
dark, the slumbrous shapes in her mind; shapes of a world not
realised but turning in their darkness, catching here and there, a
spark of light; Greece, Rome, Constantinople. Small as it was, and
shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold-
sprinkled waters flowing in and about it, it had, she supposed, a
place in the universeâ€”even that little island? The old gentlemen in
the study she thought could have told her. Sometimes she strayed in
from the garden purposely to catch them at it. There they were (it
might be Mr Carmichael or Mr Bankes who was sitting with her
father) sitting opposite each other in their low arm-chairs. They
were crackling in front of them the pages of THE TIMES, when she
came in from the garden, all in a muddle, about something some one
had said about Christ, or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in
a London street, or wondering what Napoleon was like. Then they
took all this with their clean hands (they wore grey-coloured
clothes; they smelt of heather) and they brushed the scraps
together, turning the paper, crossing their knees, and said
something now and then very brief. Just to please herself she would
take a book from the shelf and stand there, watching her father
write, so equally, so neatly from one side of the page to another,
with a little cough now and then, or something said briefly to the
other old gentleman opposite. And she thought, standing there with
her book open, one could let whatever one thought expand here like
a leaf in water; and if it did well here, among the old gentlemen
smoking and THE TIMES crackling then it was right. And watching her
father as he wrote in his study, she thought (now sitting in the
boat) he was not vain, nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you
pity him. Indeed, if he saw she was there, reading a book, he would
ask her, as gently as any one could, Was there nothing he could
give her?</p>
<p>Lest this should be wrong, she looked at him reading the little
book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover's egg. No; it was
right. Look at him now, she wanted to say aloud to James. (But
James had his eye on the sail.) He is a sarcastic brute, James
would say. He brings the talk round to himself and his books, James
would say. He is intolerably egotistical. Worst of all, he is a
tyrant. But look! she said, looking at him. Look at him now. She
looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled; the
little book whose yellowish pages she knew, without knowing what
was written on them. It was small; it was closely printed; on the
fly-leaf, she knew, he had written that he had spent fifteen francs
on dinner; the wine had been so much; he had given so much to the
waiter; all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page. But what
might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his
pocket, she did not know. What he thought they none of them knew.
But he was absorbed in it, so that when he looked up, as he did now
for an instant, it was not to see anything; it was to pin down some
thought more exactly. That done, his mind flew back again and he
plunged into his reading. He read, she thought, as if he were
guiding something, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or pushing
his way up and up a single narrow path; and sometimes he went fast
and straight, and broke his way through the bramble, and sometimes
it seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded him, but he was
not going to let himself be beaten by that; on he went, tossing
over page after page. And she went on telling herself a story about
escaping from a sinking ship, for she was safe, while he sat there;
safe, as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden, and
took a book down, and the old gentleman, lowering the paper
suddenly, said something very brief over the top of it about the
character of Napoleon.</p>
<p>She gazed back over the sea, at the island. But the leaf was
losing its sharpness. It was very small; it was very distant. The
sea was more important now than the shore. Waves were all round
them, tossing and sinking, with a log wallowing down one wave; a
gull riding on another. About here, she thought, dabbling her
fingers in the water, a ship had sunk, and she murmured, dreamily
half asleep, how we perished, each alone.</p>
