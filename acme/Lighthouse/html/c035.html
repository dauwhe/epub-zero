<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p>The sails flapped over their heads. The water chuckled and
slapped the sides of the boat, which drowsed motionless in the sun.
Now and then the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but
the ripple ran over them and ceased. The boat made no motion at
all. Mr Ramsay sat in the middle of the boat. He would be impatient
in a moment, James thought, and Cam thought, looking at her father,
who sat in the middle of the boat between them (James steered; Cam
sat alone in the bow) with his legs tightly curled. He hated
hanging about. Sure enough, after fidgeting a second or two, he
said something sharp to Macalister's boy, who got out his oars and
began to row. But their father, they knew, would never be content
until they were flying along. He would keep looking for a breeze,
fidgeting, saying things under his breath, which Macalister and and
Macalister's boy would overhear, and they would both be made
horribly uncomfortable. He had made them come. He had forced them
to come. In their anger they hoped that the breeze would never
rise, that he might be thwarted in every possible way, since he had
forced them to come against their wills.</p>
<p>All the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together,
though he bade them "Walk up, walk up,” without speaking. Their
heads were bent down, their heads were pressed down by some
remorseless gale. Speak to him they could not. They must come; they
must follow. They must walk behind him carrying brown paper
parcels. But they vowed, in silence, as they walked, to stand by
each other and carry out the great compact—to resist tyranny to the
death. So there they would sit, one at one end of the boat, one at
the other, in silence. They would say nothing, only look at him now
and then where he sat with his legs twisted, frowning and
fidgeting, and pishing and pshawing and muttering things to
himself, and waiting impatiently for a breeze. And they hoped it
would be calm. They hoped he would be thwarted. They hoped the
whole expedition would fail, and they would have to put back, with
their parcels, to the beach.</p>
<p>But now, when Macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the
sails slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened
itself, and shot off. Instantly, as if some great strain had been
relieved, Mr Ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch,
handed it with a little grunt to Macalister, and felt, they knew,
for all they suffered, perfectly content. Now they would sail on
for hours like this, and Mr Ramsay would ask old Macalister a
question—about the great storm last winter probably—and old
Macalister would answer it, and they would puff their pipes
together, and Macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers,
tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and never say a
word to any one. James would be forced to keep his eye all the time
on the sail. For if he forgot, then the sail puckered and shivered,
and the boat slackened, and Mr Ramsay would say sharply, "Look out!
Look out!” and old Macalister would turn slowly on his seat. So
they heard Mr Ramsay asking some question about the great storm at
Christmas. "She comes driving round the point,” old Macalister
said, describing the great storm last Christmas, when ten ships had
been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen "one there,
one there, one there” (he pointed slowly round the bay. Mr Ramsay
followed him, turning his head). He had seen four men clinging to
the mast. Then she was gone. "And at last we shoved her off,” he
went on (but in their anger and their silence they only caught a
word here and there, sitting at opposite ends of the boat, united
by their compact to fight tyranny to the death). At last they had
shoved her off, they had launched the lifeboat, and they had got
her out past the point—Macalister told the story; and though they
only caught a word here and there, they were conscious all the time
of their father—how he leant forward, how he brought his voice into
tune with Macalister's voice; how, puffing at his pipe, and looking
there and there where Macalister pointed, he relished the thought
of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there.
He liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at
night; pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind; he
liked men to work like that, and women to keep house, and sit
beside sleeping children indoors, while men were drowned, out there
in a storm. So James could tell, so Cam could tell (they looked at
him, they looked at each other), from his toss and his vigilance
and the ring in his voice, and the little tinge of Scottish accent
which came into his voice, making him seem like a peasant himself,
as he questioned Macalister about the eleven ships that had been
driven into the bay in a storm. Three had sunk.</p>
<p>He looked proudly where Macalister pointed; and Cam thought,
feeling proud of him without knowing quite why, had he been there
he would have launched the lifeboat, he would have reached the
wreck, Cam thought. He was so brave, he was so adventurous, Cam
thought. But she remembered. There was the compact; to resist
tyranny to the death. Their grievance weighed them down. They had
been forced; they had been bidden. He had borne them down once more
with his gloom and his authority, making them do his bidding, on
this fine morning, come, because he wished it, carrying these
parcels, to the Lighthouse; take part in these rites he went
through for his own pleasure in memory of dead people, which they
hated, so that they lagged after him, all the pleasure of the day
was spoilt.</p>
<p>Yes, the breeze was freshening. The boat was leaning, the water
was sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades, in bubbles, in
cataracts. Cam looked down into the foam, into the sea with all its
treasure in it, and its speed hypnotised her, and the tie between
her and James sagged a little. It slackened a little. She began to
think, How fast it goes. Where are we going? and the movement
hypnotised her, while James, with his eye fixed on the sail and on
the horizon, steered grimly. But he began to think as he steered
that he might escape; he might be quit of it all. They might land
somewhere; and be free then. Both of them, looking at each other
for a moment, had a sense of escape and exaltation, what with the
speed and the change. But the breeze bred in Mr Ramsay too the same
excitement, and, as old Macalister turned to fling his line
overboard, he cried out aloud,</p>
<p>“We perished,” and then again, "each alone.” And then with his
usual spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved
his hand towards the shore.</p>
<p>“See the little house,” he said pointing, wishing Cam to look.
She raised herself reluctantly and looked. But which was it? She
could no longer make out, there on the hillside, which was their
house. All looked distant and peaceful and strange. The shore
seemed refined, far away, unreal. Already the little distance they
had sailed had put them far from it and given it the changed look,
the composed look, of something receding in which one has no longer
any part. Which was their house? She could not see it.</p>
<p>“But I beneath a rougher sea,” Mr Ramsay murmured. He had found
the house and so seeing it, he had also seen himself there; he had
seen himself walking on the terrace, alone. He was walking up and
down between the urns; and he seemed to himself very old and bowed.
Sitting in the boat, he bowed, he crouched himself, acting
instantly his part— the part of a desolate man, widowed, bereft;
and so called up before him in hosts people sympathising with him;
staged for himself as he sat in the boat, a little drama; which
required of him decrepitude and exhaustion and sorrow (he raised
his hands and looked at the thinness of them, to confirm his dream)
and then there was given him in abundance women's sympathy, and he
imagined how they would soothe him and sympathise with him, and so
getting in his dream some reflection of the exquisite pleasure
women's sympathy was to him, he sighed and said gently and
mournfully:</p>
<p>But I beneath a rougher sea</p>
<p>Was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he,</p>
<p>so that the mournful words were heard quite clearly by them all.
Cam half started on her seat. It shocked her—it outraged her. The
movement roused her father; and he shuddered, and broke off,
exclaiming: "Look! Look!” so urgently that James also turned his
head to look over his shoulder at the island. They all looked. They
looked at the island.</p>
<p>But Cam could see nothing. She was thinking how all those paths
and the lawn, thick and knotted with the lives they had lived
there, were gone: were rubbed out; were past; were unreal, and now
this was real; the boat and the sail with its patch; Macalister
with his earrings; the noise of the waves—all this was real.
Thinking this, she was murmuring to herself, "We perished, each
alone,” for her father's words broke and broke again in her mind,
when her father, seeing her gazing so vaguely, began to tease her.
Didn't she know the points of the compass? he asked. Didn't she
know the North from the South? Did she really think they lived
right out there? And he pointed again, and showed her where their
house was, there, by those trees. He wished she would try to be
more accurate, he said: "Tell me—which is East, which is West?” he
said, half laughing at her, half scolding her, for he could not
understand the state of mind of any one, not absolutely imbecile,
who did not know the points of the compass. Yet she did not know.
And seeing her gazing, with her vague, now rather frightened, eyes
fixed where no house was Mr Ramsay forgot his dream; how he walked
up and down between the urns on the terrace; how the arms were
stretched out to him. He thought, women are always like that; the
vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never
been able to understand; but so it was. It had been so with her—his
wife. They could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds.
But he had been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not
rather like this vagueness in women? It was part of their
extraordinary charm. I will make her smile at me, he thought. She
looks frightened. She was so silent. He clutched his fingers, and
determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive
gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and
praise him all these years should subdue themselves. He would make
her smile at him. He would find some simple easy thing to say to
her. But what? For, wrapped up in his work as he was, he forgot the
sort of thing one said. There was a puppy. They had a puppy. Who
was looking after the puppy today? he asked. Yes, thought James
pitilessly, seeing his sister's head against the sail, now she will
give way. I shall be left to fight the tyrant alone. The compact
would be left to him to carry out. Cam would never resist tyranny
to the death, he thought grimly, watching her face, sad, sulky,
yielding. And as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green
hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding
hills is gloom and sorrow, and it seems as if the hills themselves
must ponder the fate of the clouded, the darkened, either in pity,
or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay: so Cam now felt herself
overcast, as she sat there among calm, resolute people and wondered
how to answer her father about the puppy; how to resist his
entreaty—forgive me, care for me; while James the lawgiver, with
the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee (his hand on
the tiller had become symbolical to her), said, Resist him. Fight
him. He said so rightly; justly. For they must fight tyranny to the
death, she thought. Of all human qualities she reverenced justice
most. Her brother was most god-like, her father most suppliant. And
to which did she yield, she thought, sitting between them, gazing
at the shore whose points were all unknown to her, and thinking how
the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and
peace dwelt there.</p>
<p>“Jasper,” she said sullenly. He'd look after the puppy.</p>
<p>And what was she going to call him? her father persisted. He had
had a dog when he was a little boy, called Frisk. She'll give way,
James thought, as he watched a look come upon her face, a look he
remembered. They look down he thought, at their knitting or
something. Then suddenly they look up. There was a flash of blue,
he remembered, and then somebody sitting with him laughed,
surrendered, and he was very angry. It must have been his mother,
he thought, sitting on a low chair, with his father standing over
her. He began to search among the infinite series of impressions
which time had laid down, leaf upon leaf, fold upon fold softly,
incessantly upon his brain; among scents, sounds; voices, harsh,
hollow, sweet; and lights passing, and brooms tapping; and the wash
and hush of the sea, how a man had marched up and down and stopped
dead, upright, over them. Meanwhile, he noticed, Cam dabbled her
fingers in the water, and stared at the shore and said nothing. No,
she won't give way, he thought; she's different, he thought. Well,
if Cam would not answer him, he would not bother her Mr Ramsay
decided, feeling in his pocket for a book. But she would answer
him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon
her tongue and to say, Oh, yes, Frisk. I'll call him Frisk. She
wanted even to say, Was that the dog that found its way over the
moor alone? But try as she might, she could think of nothing to say
like that, fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her
father, unsuspected by James, a private token of the love she felt
for him. For she thought, dabbling her hand (and now Macalister's
boy had caught a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with
blood on its gills) for she thought, looking at James who kept his
eyes dispassionately on the sail, or glanced now and then for a
second at the horizon, you're not exposed to it, to this pressure
and division of feeling, this extraordinary temptation. Her father
was feeling in his pockets; in another second, he would have found
his book. For no one attracted her more; his hands were beautiful,
and his feet, and his voice, and his words, and his haste, and his
temper, and his oddity, and his passion, and his saying straight
out before every one, we perish, each alone, and his remoteness.
(He had opened his book.) But what remained intolerable, she
thought, sitting upright, and watching Macalister's boy tug the
hook out of the gills of another fish, was that crass blindness and
tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter
storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage
and remembered some command of his; some insolence: "Do this,” "Do
that,” his dominance: his "Submit to me.”</p>
<p>So she said nothing, but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore,
wrapped in its mantle of peace; as if the people there had fallen
asleep, she thought; were free like smoke, were free to come and go
like ghosts. They have no suffering there, she thought.</p>
