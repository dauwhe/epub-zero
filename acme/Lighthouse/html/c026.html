<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
</div>


<p>The Spring without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin
fierce in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on
fields wide- eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was
done or thought by the beholders. [Prue Ramsay, leaning on her
father's arm, was given in marriage. What, people said, could have
been more fitting? And, they added, how beautiful she looked!]</p>
<p>As summer neared, as the evenings lengthened, there came to the
wakeful, the hopeful, walking the beach, stirring the pool,
imaginations of the strangest kind—of flesh turned to atoms which
drove before the wind, of stars flashing in their hearts, of cliff,
sea, cloud, and sky brought purposely together to assemble
outwardly the scattered parts of the vision within. In those
mirrors, the minds of men, in those pools of uneasy water, in which
clouds for ever turn and shadows form, dreams persisted, and it was
impossible to resist the strange intimation which every gull,
flower, tree, man and woman, and the white earth itself seemed to
declare (but if questioned at once to withdraw) that good triumphs,
happiness prevails, order rules; or to resist the extraordinary
stimulus to range hither and thither in search of some absolute
good, some crystal of intensity, remote from the known pleasures
and familiar virtues, something alien to the processes of domestic
life, single, hard, bright, like a diamond in the sand, which would
render the possessor secure. Moreover, softened and acquiescent,
the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak
about her, veiled her eyes, averted her head, and among passing
shadows and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a
knowledge of the sorrows of mankind.</p>
<p>[Prue Ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with
childbirth, which was indeed a tragedy, people said, everything,
they said, had promised so well.]</p>
<p>And now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the
house again. Flies wove a web in the sunny rooms; weeds that had
grown close to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the
window pane. When darkness fell, the stroke of the Lighthouse,
which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the
darkness, tracing its pattern, came now in the softer light of
spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress
and lingered steathily and looked and came lovingly again. But in
the very lull of this loving caress, as the long stroke leant upon
the bed, the rock was rent asunder; another fold of the shawl
loosened; there it hung, and swayed. Through the short summer
nights and the long summer days, when the empty rooms seemed to
murmur with the echoes of the fields and the hum of flies, the long
streamer waved gently, swayed aimlessly; while the sun so striped
and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that Mrs
McNab, when she broke in and lurched about, dusting, sweeping,
looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun-lanced
waters.</p>
<p>But slumber and sleep though it might there came later in the
summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of hammers dulled on
felt, which, with their repeated shocks still further loosened the
shawl and cracked the tea-cups. Now and again some glass tinkled in
the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony
that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too. Then again
silence fell; and then, night after night, and sometimes in plain
mid-day when the roses were bright and light turned on the wall its
shape clearly there seemed to drop into this silence, this
indifference, this integrity, the thud of something falling.</p>
<p>[A shell exploded. Twenty or thirty young men were blown up in
France, among them Andrew Ramsay, whose death, mercifully, was
instantaneous.]</p>
<p>At that season those who had gone down to pace the beach and ask
of the sea and sky what message they reported or what vision they
affirmed had to consider among the usual tokens of divine
bounty—the sunset on the sea, the pallor of dawn, the moon rising,
fishing-boats against the moon, and children making mud pies or
pelting each other with handfuls of grass, something out of harmony
with this jocundity and this serenity. There was the silent
apparition of an ashen-coloured ship for instance, come, gone;
there was a purplish stain upon the bland surface of the sea as if
something had boiled and bled, invisibly, beneath. This intrusion
into a scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and
lead to the most comfortable conclusions stayed their pacing. It
was difficult blandly to overlook them; to abolish their
significance in the landscape; to continue, as one walked by the
sea, to marvel how beauty outside mirrored beauty within.</p>
<p>Did Nature supplement what man advanced? Did she complete what
he began? With equal complacence she saw his misery, his meanness,
and his torture. That dream, of sharing, completing, of finding in
solitude on the beach an answer, was then but a reflection in a
mirror, and the mirror itself was but the surface glassiness which
forms in quiescence when the nobler powers sleep beneath?
Impatient, despairing yet loth to go (for beauty offers her lures,
has her consolations), to pace the beach was impossible;
contemplation was unendurable; the mirror was broken.</p>
<p>[Mr Carmichael brought out a volume of poems that spring, which
had an unexpected success. The war, people said, had revived their
interest in poetry.]</p>
