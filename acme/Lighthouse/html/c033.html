<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>She seemed to have shrivelled slightly, he thought. She looked a
little skimpy, wispy; but not unattractive. He liked her. There had
been some talk of her marrying William Bankes once, but nothing had
come of it. His wife had been fond of her. He had been a little out
of temper too at breakfast. And then, and then—this was one of
those moments when an enormous need urged him, without being
conscious what it was, to approach any woman, to force them, he did
not care how, his need was so great, to give him what he wanted:
sympathy.</p>
<p>Was anybody looking after her? he said. Had she everything she
wanted?</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks, everything,” said Lily Briscoe nervously. No; she
could not do it. She ought to have floated off instantly upon some
wave of sympathetic expansion: the pressure on her was tremendous.
But she remained stuck. There was an awful pause. They both looked
at the sea. Why, thought Mr Ramsay, should she look at the sea when
I am here? She hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at
the Lighthouse, she said. The Lighthouse! The Lighthouse! What's
that got to do with it? he thought impatiently. Instantly, with the
force of some primeval gust (for really he could not restrain
himself any longer), there issued from him such a groan that any
other woman in the whole world would have done something, said
something—all except myself, thought Lily, girding at herself
bitterly, who am not a woman, but a peevish, ill-tempered, dried-up
old maid, presumably.</p>
<p>[Mr Ramsay sighed to the full. He waited. Was she not going to
say anything? Did she not see what he wanted from her? Then he said
he had a particular reason for wanting to go to the Lighthouse. His
wife used to send the men things. There was a poor boy with a
tuberculous hip, the lightkeeper's son. He sighed profoundly. He
sighed significantly. All Lily wished was that this enormous flood
of grief, this insatiable hunger for sympathy, this demand that she
should surrender herself up to him entirely, and even so he had
sorrows enough to keep her supplied for ever, should leave her,
should be diverted (she kept looking at the house, hoping for an
interruption) before it swept her down in its flow.</p>
<p>“Such expeditions,” said Mr Ramsay, scraping the ground with his
toe, "are very painful.” Still Lily said nothing. (She is a stock,
she is a stone, he said to himself.) "They are very exhausting,” he
said, looking, with a sickly look that nauseated her (he was
acting, she felt, this great man was dramatising himself), at his
beautiful hands. It was horrible, it was indecent. Would they never
come, she asked, for she could not sustain this enormous weight of
sorrow, support these heavy draperies of grief (he had assumed a
pose of extreme decreptitude; he even tottered a little as he stood
there) a moment longer.</p>
<p>Still she could say nothing; the whole horizon seemed swept bare
of objects to talk about; could only feel, amazedly, as Mr Ramsay
stood there, how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny
grass and discolour it, and cast over the rubicund, drowsy,
entirely contented figure of Mr Carmichael, reading a French novel
on a deck-chair, a veil of crape, as if such an existence,
flaunting its prosperity in a world of woe, were enough to provoke
the most dismal thoughts of all. Look at him, he seemed to be
saying, look at me; and indeed, all the time he was feeling, Think
of me, think of me. Ah, could that bulk only be wafted alongside of
them, Lily wished; had she only pitched her easel a yard or two
closer to him; a man, any man, would staunch this effusion, would
stop these lamentations. A woman, she had provoked this horror; a
woman, she should have known how to deal with it. It was immensely
to her discredit, sexually, to stand there dumb. One said—what did
one say?—Oh, Mr Ramsay! Dear Mr Ramsay! That was what that kind old
lady who sketched, Mrs Beckwith, would have said instantly, and
rightly. But, no. They stood there, isolated from the rest of the
world. His immense self-pity, his demand for sympathy poured and
spread itself in pools at ther feet, and all she did, miserable
sinner that she was, was to draw her skirts a little closer round
her ankles, lest she should get wet. In complete silence she stood
there, grasping her paint brush.</p>
<p>Heaven could never be sufficiently praised! She heard sounds in
the house. James and Cam must be coming. But Mr Ramsay, as if he
knew that his time ran short, exerted upon her solitary figure the
immense pressure of his concentrated woe; his age; his frailty: his
desolation; when suddenly, tossing his head impatiently, in his
annoyance—for after all, what woman could resist him?—he noticed
that his boot-laces were untied. Remarkable boots they were too,
Lily thought, looking down at them: sculptured; colossal; like
everything that Mr Ramsay wore, from his frayed tie to his
half-buttoned waistcoat, his own indisputably. She could see them
walking to his room of their own accord, expressive in his absence
of pathos, surliness, ill-temper, charm.</p>
<p>“What beautiful boots!” she exclaimed. She was ashamed of
herself. To praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul;
when he had shown her his bleeding hands, his lacerated heart, and
asked her to pity them, then to say, cheerfully, "Ah, but what
beautiful boots you wear!” deserved, she knew, and she looked up
expecting to get it in one of his sudden roars of ill-temper
complete annihilation.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr Ramsay smiled. His pall, his draperies, his
infirmities fell from him. Ah, yes, he said, holding his foot up
for her to look at, they were first-rate boots. There was only one
man in England who could make boots like that. Boots are among the
chief curses of mankind, he said. "Bootmakers make it their
business,” he exclaimed, "to cripple and torture the human foot."
They are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind. It had
taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they
should be made. He would have her observe (he lifted his right foot
and then his left) that she had never seen boots made quite that
shape before. They were made of the finest leather in the world,
also. Most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard. He looked
complacently at his foot, still held in the air. They had reached,
she felt, a sunny island where peace dwelt, sanity reigned and the
sun for ever shone, the blessed island of good boots. Her heart
warmed to him. "Now let me see if you can tie a knot,” he said. He
poohpoohed her feeble system. He showed her his own invention. Once
you tied it, it never came undone. Three times he knotted her shoe;
three times he unknotted it.</p>
<p>Why, at this completely inappropriate moment, when he was
stooping over her shoe, should she be so tormented with sympathy
for him that, as she stooped too, the blood rushed to her face,
and, thinking of her callousness (she had called him a play-actor)
she felt her eyes swell and tingle with tears? Thus occupied he
seemed to her a figure of infinite pathos. He tied knots. He bought
boots. There was no helping Mr Ramsay on the journey he was going.
But now just as she wished to say something, could have said
something, perhaps, here they were—Cam and James. They appeared on
the terrace. They came, lagging, side by side, a serious,
melancholy couple.</p>
<p>But why was it like THAT that they came? She could not help
feeling annoyed with them; they might have come more cheerfully;
they might have given him what, now that they were off, she would
not have the chance of giving him. For she felt a sudden emptiness;
a frustration. Her feeling had come too late; there it was ready;
but he no longer needed it. He had become a very distinguished,
elderly man, who had no need of her whatsoever. She felt snubbed.
He slung a knapsack round his shoulders. He shared out the
parcels—there were a number of them, ill tied in brown paper. He
sent Cam for a cloak. He had all the appearance of a leader making
ready for an expedition. Then, wheeling about, he led the way with
his firm military tread, in those wonderful boots, carrying brown
paper parcels, down the path, his children following him. They
looked, she thought, as if fate had devoted them to some stern
enterprise, and they went to it, still young enough to be drawn
acquiescent in their father's wake, obediently, but with a pallor
in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something
beyond their years in silence. So they passed the edge of the lawn,
and it seemed to Lily that she watched a procession go, drawn on by
some stress of common feeling which made it, faltering and flagging
as it was, a little company bound together and strangely impressive
to her. Politely, but very distantly, Mr Ramsay raised his hand and
saluted her as they passed.</p>
<p>But what a face, she thought, immediately finding the sympathy
which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression.
What had made it like that? Thinking, night after night, she
supposed—about the reality of kitchen tables, she added,
remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what Mr Ramsay
did think about Andrew had given her. (He had been killed by the
splinter of a shell instantly, she bethought her.) The kitchen
table was something visionary, austere; something bare, hard, not
ornamental. There was no colour to it; it was all edges and angles;
it was uncompromisingly plain. But Mr Ramsay kept always his eyes
fixed upon it, never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded,
until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this
unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her. Then, she
recalled (standing where he had left her, holding her brush),
worries had fretted it—not so nobly. He must have had his doubts
about that table, she supposed; whether the table was a real table;
whether it was worth the time he gave to it; whether he was able
after all to find it. He had had doubts, she felt, or he would have
asked less of people. That was what they talked about late at night
sometimes, she suspected; and then next day Mrs Ramsay looked
tired, and Lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little
thing. But now he had nobody to talk to about that table, or his
boots, or his knots; and he was like a lion seeking whom he could
devour, and his face had that touch of desperation, of exaggeration
in it which alarmed her, and made her pull her skirts about her.
And then, she recalled, there was that sudden revivification, that
sudden flare (when she praised his boots), that sudden recovery of
vitality and interest in ordinary human things, which too passed
and changed (for he was always changing, and hid nothing) into that
other final phase which was new to her and had, she owned, made
herself ashamed of her own irritability, when it seemed as if he
had shed worries and ambitions, and the hope of sympathy and the
desire for praise, had entered some other region, was drawn on, as
if by curiosity, in dumb colloquy, whether with himself or another,
at the head of that little procession out of one's range. An
extraordinary face! The gate banged.</p>
