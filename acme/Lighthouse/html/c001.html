<p>“Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow,” said Mrs Ramsay. "But
you'll have to be up with the lark,” she added.</p>
<p>To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it
were settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the
wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it
seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within
touch. Since he belonged, even at the age of six, to that great
clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that, but must
let future prospects, with their joys and sorrows, cloud what is
actually at hand, since to such people even in earliest childhood
any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and
transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests, James
Ramsay, sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the
illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores, endowed the
picture of a refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly
bliss. It was fringed with joy. The wheelbarrow, the lawnmower, the
sound of poplar trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing,
brooms knocking, dresses rustling—all these were so coloured and
distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his
secret language, though he appeared the image of stark and
uncompromising severity, with his high forehead and his fierce blue
eyes, impeccably candid and pure, frowning slightly at the sight of
human frailty, so that his mother, watching him guide his scissors
neatly round the refrigerator, imagined him all red and ermine on
the Bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some
crisis of public affairs.</p>
<p>“But,” said his father, stopping in front of the drawing-room
window, "it won't be fine.”</p>
<p>Had there been an axe handy, a poker, or any weapon that would
have gashed a hole in his father's breast and killed him, there and
then, James would have seized it. Such were the extremes of emotion
that Mr Ramsay excited in his children's breasts by his mere
presence; standing, as now, lean as a knife, narrow as the blade of
one, grinning sarcastically, not only with the pleasure of
disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife, who was
ten thousand times better in every way than he was (James thought),
but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement.
What he said was true. It was always true. He was incapable of
untruth; never tampered with a fact; never altered a disagreeable
word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being, least
of all of his own children, who, sprung from his loins, should be
aware from childhood that life is difficult; facts uncompromising;
and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are
extinguished, our frail barks founder in darkness (here Mr Ramsay
would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the
horizon), one that needs, above all, courage, truth, and the power
to endure.</p>
<p>“But it may be fine—I expect it will be fine,” said Mrs Ramsay,
making some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was
knitting, impatiently. If she finished it tonight, if they did go
to the Lighthouse after all, it was to be given to the Lighthouse
keeper for his little boy, who was threatened with a tuberculous
hip; together with a pile of old magazines, and some tobacco,
indeed, whatever she could find lying about, not really wanted, but
only littering the room, to give those poor fellows, who must be
bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the
lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden,
something to amuse them. For how would you like to be shut up for a
whole month at a time, and possibly more in stormy weather, upon a
rock the size of a tennis lawn? she would ask; and to have no
letters or newspapers, and to see nobody; if you were married, not
to see your wife, not to know how your children were,—if they were
ill, if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms; to see
the same dreary waves breaking week after week, and then a dreadful
storm coming, and the windows covered with spray, and birds dashed
against the lamp, and the whole place rocking, and not be able to
put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea?
How would you like that? she asked, addressing herself particularly
to her daughters. So she added, rather differently, one must take
them whatever comforts one can.</p>
<p>“It's due west,” said the atheist Tansley, holding his bony
fingers spread so that the wind blew through them, for he was
sharing Mr Ramsay's evening walk up and down, up and down the
terrace. That is to say, the wind blew from the worst possible
direction for landing at the Lighthouse. Yes, he did say
disagreeable things, Mrs Ramsay admitted; it was odious of him to
rub this in, and make James still more disappointed; but at the
same time, she would not let them laugh at him. "The atheist,” they
called him; "the little atheist.” Rose mocked him; Prue mocked him;
Andrew, Jasper, Roger mocked him; even old Badger without a tooth
in his head had bit him, for being (as Nancy put it) the hundred
and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the Hebrides
when it was ever so much nicer to be alone.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Mrs Ramsay, with great severity. Apart from the
habit of exaggeration which they had from her, and from the
implication (which was true) that she asked too many people to
stay, and had to lodge some in the town, she could not bear
incivility to her guests, to young men in particular, who were poor
as churchmice, "exceptionally able,” her husband said, his great
admirers, and come there for a holiday. Indeed, she had the whole
of the other sex under her protection; for reasons she could not
explain, for their chivalry and valour, for the fact that they
negotiated treaties, ruled India, controlled finance; finally for
an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to
find agreeable, something trustful, childlike, reverential; which
an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity,
and woe betide the girl—pray Heaven it was none of her
daughters!—who did not feel the worth of it, and all that it
implied, to the marrow of her bones!</p>
<p>She turned with severity upon Nancy. He had not chased them, she
said. He had been asked.</p>
<p>They must find a way out of it all. There might be some simpler
way, some less laborious way, she sighed. When she looked in the
glass and saw her hair grey, her cheek sunk, at fifty, she thought,
possibly she might have managed things better—her husband; money;
his books. But for her own part she would never for a single second
regret her decision, evade difficulties, or slur over duties. She
was now formidable to behold, and it was only in silence, looking
up from their plates, after she had spoken so severely about
Charles Tansley, that her daughters, Prue, Nancy, Rose—could sport
with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life
different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a wilder life; not always
taking care of some man or other; for there was in all their minds
a mute questioning of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of
England and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers and lace, though
to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty,
which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts, and made
them, as they sat at table beneath their mother's eyes, honour her
strange severity, her extreme courtesy, like a queen's raising from
the mud to wash a beggar's dirty foot, when she admonished them so
very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them—or,
speaking accurately, been invited to stay with them—in the Isle of
Skye.</p>
<p>“There'll be no landing at the Lighthouse tomorrow,” said
Charles Tansley, clapping his hands together as he stood at the
window with her husband. Surely, he had said enough. She wished
they would both leave her and James alone and go on talking. She
looked at him. He was such a miserable specimen, the children said,
all humps and hollows. He couldn't play cricket; he poked; he
shuffled. He was a sarcastic brute, Andrew said. They knew what he
liked best—to be for ever walking up and down, up and down, with Mr
Ramsay, and saying who had won this, who had won that, who was a
"first rate man” at Latin verses, who was "brilliant but I think
fundamentally unsound,” who was undoubtedly the "ablest fellow in
Balliol,” who had buried his light temporarily at Bristol or
Bedford, but was bound to be heard of later when his Prolegomena,
of which Mr Tansley had the first pages in proof with him if Mr
Ramsay would like to see them, to some branch of mathematics or
philosophy saw the light of day. That was what they talked
about.</p>
<p>She could not help laughing herself sometimes. She said, the
other day, something about "waves mountains high.” Yes, said
Charles Tansley, it was a little rough. "Aren't you drenched to the
skin?” she had said. "Damp, not wet through,” said Mr Tansley,
pinching his sleeve, feeling his socks.</p>
<p>But it was not that they minded, the children said. It was not
his face; it was not his manners. It was him—his point of view.
When they talked about something interesting, people, music,
history, anything, even said it was a fine evening so why not sit
out of doors, then what they complained of about Charles Tansley
was that until he had turned the whole thing round and made it
somehow reflect himself and disparage them—he was not satisfied.
And he would go to picture galleries they said, and he would ask
one, did one like his tie? God knows, said Rose, one did not.</p>
<p>Disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner-table
directly the meal was over, the eight sons and daughters of Mr and
Mrs Ramsay sought their bedrooms, their fastness in a house where
there was no other privacy to debate anything, everything;
Tansley's tie; the passing of the Reform Bill; sea birds and
butterflies; people; while the sun poured into those attics, which
a plank alone separated from each other so that every footstep
could be plainly heard and the Swiss girl sobbing for her father
who was dying of cancer in a valley of the Grisons, and lit up
bats, flannels, straw hats, ink-pots, paint-pots, beetles, and the
skulls of small birds, while it drew from the long frilled strips
of seaweed pinned to the wall a smell of salt and weeds, which was
in the towels too, gritty with sand from bathing.</p>
<p>Strife, divisions, difference of opinion, prejudices twisted
into the very fibre of being, oh, that they should begin so early,
Mrs Ramsay deplored. They were so critical, her children. They
talked such nonsense. She went from the dining-room, holding James
by the hand, since he would not go with the others. It seemed to
her such nonsense—inventing differences, when people, heaven knows,
were different enough without that. The real differences, she
thought, standing by the drawing-room window, are enough, quite
enough. She had in mind at the moment, rich and poor, high and low;
the great in birth receiving from her, half grudging, some respect,
for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble, if
slightly mythical, Italian house, whose daughters, scattered about
English drawing-rooms in the nineteenth century, had lisped so
charmingly, had stormed so wildly, and all her wit and her bearing
and her temper came from them, and not from the sluggish English,
or the cold Scotch; but more profoundly, she ruminated the other
problem, of rich and poor, and the things she saw with her own
eyes, weekly, daily, here or in London, when she visited this
widow, or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm, and
a note-book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns
carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings, employment and
unemployment, in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private
woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation, half a
relief to her own curiosity, and become what with her untrained
mind she greatly admired, an investigator, elucidating the social
problem.</p>
<p>Insoluble questions they were, it seemed to her, standing there,
holding James by the hand. He had followed her into the
drawing-room, that young man they laughed at; he was standing by
the table, fidgeting with something, awkwardly, feeling himself out
of things, as she knew without looking round. They had all gone—the
children; Minta Doyle and Paul Rayley; Augustus Carmichael; her
husband—they had all gone. So she turned with a sigh and said,
"Would it bore you to come with me, Mr Tansley?”</p>
<p>She had a dull errand in the town; she had a letter or two to
write; she would be ten minutes perhaps; she would put on her hat.
And, with her basket and her parasol, there she was again, ten
minutes later, giving out a sense of being ready, of being equipped
for a jaunt, which, however, she must interrupt for a moment, as
they passed the tennis lawn, to ask Mr Carmichael, who was basking
with his yellow cat's eyes ajar, so that like a cat's they seemed
to reflect the branches moving or the clouds passing, but to give
no inkling of any inner thoughts or emotion whatsoever, if he
wanted anything.</p>
<p>For they were making the great expedition, she said, laughing.
They were going to the town. "Stamps, writing-paper, tobacco?” she
suggested, stopping by his side. But no, he wanted nothing. His
hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch, his eyes
blinked, as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these
blandishments (she was seductive but a little nervous) but could
not, sunk as he was in a grey-green somnolence which embraced them
all, without need of words, in a vast and benevolent lethargy of
well-wishing; all the house; all the world; all the people in it,
for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of
something, which accounted, the children thought, for the vivid
streak of canary-yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise
milk white. No, nothing, he murmured.</p>
<p>He should have been a great philosopher, said Mrs Ramsay, as
they went down the road to the fishing village, but he had made an
unfortunate marriage. Holding her black parasol very erect, and
moving with an indescribable air of expectation, as if she were
going to meet some one round the corner, she told the story; an
affair at Oxford with some girl; an early marriage; poverty; going
to India; translating a little poetry "very beautifully, I
believe,” being willing to teach the boys Persian or Hindustanee,
but what really was the use of that?—and then lying, as they saw
him, on the lawn.</p>
<p>It flattered him; snubbed as he had been, it soothed him that
Mrs Ramsay should tell him this. Charles Tansley revived.
Insinuating, too, as she did the greatness of man's intellect, even
in its decay, the subjection of all wives—not that she blamed the
girl, and the marriage had been happy enough, she believed—to their
husband's labours, she made him feel better pleased with himself
than he had done yet, and he would have liked, had they taken a
cab, for example, to have paid the fare. As for her little bag,
might he not carry that? No, no, she said, she always carried THAT
herself. She did too. Yes, he felt that in her. He felt many
things, something in particular that excited him and disturbed him
for reasons which he could not give. He would like her to see him,
gowned and hooded, walking in a procession. A fellowship, a
professorship, he felt capable of anything and saw himself—but what
was she looking at? At a man pasting a bill. The vast flapping
sheet flattened itself out, and each shove of the brush revealed
fresh legs, hoops, horses, glistening reds and blues, beautifully
smooth, until half the wall was covered with the advertisement of a
circus; a hundred horsemen, twenty performing seals, lions, tigers…
Craning forwards, for she was short-sighted, she read it out… "will
visit this town,” she read. It was terribly dangerous work for a
one-armed man, she exclaimed, to stand on top of a ladder like
that—his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years
ago.</p>
<p>“Let us all go!” she cried, moving on, as if all those riders
and horses had filled her with childlike exultation and made her
forget her pity.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” he said, repeating her words, clicking them out,
however, with a self-consciousness that made her wince. "Let us all
go to the circus.” No. He could not say it right. He could not feel
it right. But why not? she wondered. What was wrong with him then?
She liked him warmly, at the moment. Had they not been taken, she
asked, to circuses when they were children? Never, he answered, as
if she asked the very thing he wanted; had been longing all these
days to say, how they did not go to circuses. It was a large
family, nine brothers and sisters, and his father was a working
man. "My father is a chemist, Mrs Ramsay. He keeps a shop.” He
himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen. Often he went
without a greatcoat in winter. He could never "return hospitality"
(those were his parched stiff words) at college. He had to make
things last twice the time other people did; he smoked the cheapest
tobacco; shag; the same the old men did in the quays. He worked
hard—seven hours a day; his subject was now the influence of
something upon somebody—they were walking on and Mrs Ramsay did not
quite catch the meaning, only the words, here and there…
dissertation… fellowship… readership… lectureship. She could not
follow the ugly academic jargon, that rattled itself off so glibly,
but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had
knocked him off his perch, poor little man, and why he came out,
instantly, with all that about his father and mother and brothers
and sisters, and she would see to it that they didn't laugh at him
any more; she would tell Prue about it. What he would have liked,
she supposed, would have been to say how he had gone not to the
circus but to Ibsen with the Ramsays. He was an awful prig—oh yes,
an insufferable bore. For, though they had reached the town now and
were in the main street, with carts grinding past on the cobbles,
still he went on talking, about settlements, and teaching, and
working men, and helping our own class, and lectures, till she
gathered that he had got back entire self-confidence, had recovered
from the circus, and was about (and now again she liked him warmly)
to tell her—but here, the houses falling away on both sides, they
came out on the quay, and the whole bay spread before them and Mrs
Ramsay could not help exclaiming, "Oh, how beautiful!” For the
great plateful of blue water was before her; the hoary Lighthouse,
distant, austere, in the midst; and on the right, as far as the eye
could see, fading and falling, in soft low pleats, the green sand
dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them, which always seemed to
be running away into some moon country, uninhabited of men.</p>
<p>That was the view, she said, stopping, growing greyer-eyed, that
her husband loved.</p>
<p>She paused a moment. But now, she said, artists had come here.
There indeed, only a few paces off, stood one of them, in Panama
hat and yellow boots, seriously, softly, absorbedly, for all that
he was watched by ten little boys, with an air of profound
contentment on his round red face gazing, and then, when he had
gazed, dipping; imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of
green or pink. Since Mr Paunceforte had been there, three years
before, all the pictures were like that, she said, green and grey,
with lemon-coloured sailing-boats, and pink women on the beach.</p>
<p>But her grandmother's friends, she said, glancing discreetly as
they passed, took the greatest pains; first they mixed their own
colours, and then they ground them, and then they put damp cloths
to keep them moist.</p>
<p>So Mr Tansley supposed she meant him to see that that man's
picture was skimpy, was that what one said? The colours weren't
solid? Was that what one said? Under the influence of that
extraordinary emotion which had been growing all the walk, had
begun in the garden when he had wanted to take her bag, had
increased in the town when he had wanted to tell her everything
about himself, he was coming to see himself, and everything he had
ever known gone crooked a little. It was awfully strange.</p>
<p>There he stood in the parlour of the poky little house where she
had taken him, waiting for her, while she went upstairs a moment to
see a woman. He heard her quick step above; heard her voice
cheerful, then low; looked at the mats, tea-caddies, glass shades;
waited quite impatiently; looked forward eagerly to the walk home;
determined to carry her bag; then heard her come out; shut a door;
say they must keep the windows open and the doors shut, ask at the
house for anything they wanted (she must be talking to a child)
when, suddenly, in she came, stood for a moment silent (as if she
had been pretending up there, and for a moment let herself be now),
stood quite motionless for a moment against a picture of Queen
Victoria wearing the blue ribbon of the Garter; when all at once he
realised that it was this: it was this:—she was the most beautiful
person he had ever seen.</p>
<p>With stars in her eyes and veils in her hair, with cyclamen and
wild violets—what nonsense was he thinking? She was fifty at least;
she had eight children. Stepping through fields of flowers and
taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had
fallen; with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair—He had
hold of her bag.</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Elsie,” she said, and they walked up the street, she
holding her parasol erect and walking as if she expected to meet
some one round the corner, while for the first time in his life
Charles Tansley felt an extraordinary pride; a man digging in a
drain stopped digging and looked at her, let his arm fall down and
looked at her; for the first time in his life Charles Tansley felt
an extraordinary pride; felt the wind and the cyclamen and the
violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman. He had hold of
her bag.</p>
