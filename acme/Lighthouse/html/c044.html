<p>“He must have reached it,” said Lily Briscoe aloud, feeling
suddenly completely tired out. For the Lighthouse had become almost
invisible, had melted away into a blue haze, and the effort of
looking at it and the effort of thinking of him landing there,
which both seemed to be one and the same effort, had stretched her
body and mind to the utmost. Ah, but she was relieved. Whatever she
had wanted to give him, when he left her that morning, she had
given him at last.</p>
<p>“He has landed,” she said aloud. "It is finished.” Then, surging
up, puffing slightly, old Mr Carmichael stood beside her, looking
like an old pagan god, shaggy, with weeds in his hair and the
trident (it was only a French novel) in his hand. He stood by her
on the edge of the lawn, swaying a little in his bulk and said,
shading his eyes with his hand: "They will have landed,” and she
felt that she had been right. They had not needed to speak. They
had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without
her asking him anything. He stood there as if he were spreading his
hands over all the weakness and suffering of mankind; she thought
he was surveying, tolerantly and compassionately, their final
destiny. Now he has crowned the occasion, she thought, when his
hand slowly fell, as if she had seen him let fall from his great
height a wreath of violets and asphodels which, fluttering slowly,
lay at length upon the earth.</p>
<p>Quickly, as if she were recalled by something over there, she
turned to her canvas. There it was—her picture. Yes, with all its
greens and blues, its lines running up and across, its attempt at
something. It would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be
destroyed. But what did that matter? she asked herself, taking up
her brush again. She looked at the steps; they were empty; she
looked at her canvas; it was blurred. With a sudden intensity, as
if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a line there, in the
centre. It was done; it was finished. Yes, she thought, laying down
her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision.</p>
