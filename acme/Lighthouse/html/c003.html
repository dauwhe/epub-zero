<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>“Perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds
singing,” she said compassionately, smoothing the little boy's
hair, for her husband, with his caustic saying that it would not be
fine, had dashed his spirits she could see. This going to the
Lighthouse was a passion of his, she saw, and then, as if her
husband had not said enough, with his caustic saying that it would
not be fine tomorrow, this odious little man went and rubbed it in
all over again.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it will be fine tomorrow,” she said, smoothing his
hair.</p>
<p>All she could do now was to admire the refrigerator, and turn
the pages of the Stores list in the hope that she might come upon
something like a rake, or a mowing-machine, which, with its prongs
and its handles, would need the greatest skill and care in cutting
out. All these young men parodied her husband, she reflected; he
said it would rain; they said it would be a positive tornado.</p>
<p>But here, as she turned the page, suddenly her search for the
picture of a rake or a mowing-machine was interrupted. The gruff
murmur, irregularly broken by the taking out of pipes and the
putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her, though she
could not hear what was said (as she sat in the window which opened
on the terrace), that the men were happily talking; this sound,
which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place
soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her, such as
the tap of balls upon bats, the sharp, sudden bark now and then,
"How's that? How's that?” of the children playing cricket, had
ceased; so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach,
which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her
thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as
she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song,
murmured by nature, "I am guarding you—I am your support,” but at
other times suddenly and unexpectedly, especially when her mind
raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand, had no such
kindly meaning, but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat
the measure of life, made one think of the destruction of the
island and its engulfment in the sea, and warned her whose day had
slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all
ephermal as a rainbow—this sound which had been obscured and
concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her
ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror.</p>
<p>They had ceased to talk; that was the explanation. Falling in
one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other
extreme which, as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of
emotion, was cool, amused, and even faintly malicious, she
concluded that poor Charles Tansley had been shed. That was of
little account to her. If her husband required sacrifices (and
indeed he did) she cheerfully offered up to him Charles Tansley,
who had snubbed her little boy.</p>
<p>One moment more, with her head raised, she listened, as if she
waited for some habitual sound, some regular mechanical sound; and
then, hearing something rhythmical, half said, half chanted,
beginning in the garden, as her husband beat up and down the
terrace, something between a croak and a song, she was soothed once
more, assured again that all was well, and looking down at the book
on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades
which could only be cut out if James was very careful.</p>
<p>Suddenly a loud cry, as of a sleep-walker, half roused,
something about</p>
<p>Stormed at with shot and shell</p>
<p>sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear, made her turn
apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him. Only Lily Briscoe,
she was glad to find; and that did not matter. But the sight of the
girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her; she
was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as
possible for Lily's picture. Lily's picture! Mrs Ramsay smiled.
With her little Chinese eyes and her puckered-up face, she would
never marry; one could not take her painting very seriously; she
was an independent little creature, and Mrs Ramsay liked her for
it; so, remembering her promise, she bent her head.</p>
