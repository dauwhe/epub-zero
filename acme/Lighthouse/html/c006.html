<p>But what had happened?</p>
<p>Some one had blundered.</p>
<p>Starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had
held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time. "Some one
had blundered"—Fixing her short-sighted eyes upon her husband, who
was now bearing down upon her, she gazed steadily until his
closeness revealed to her (the jingle mated itself in her head)
that something had happened, some one had blundered. But she could
not for the life of her think what.</p>
<p>He shivered; he quivered. All his vanity, all his satisfaction
in his own splendour, riding fell as a thunderbolt, fierce as a
hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death, had been
shattered, destroyed. Stormed at by shot and shell, boldly we rode
and well, flashed through the valley of death, volleyed and
thundered—straight into Lily Briscoe and William Bankes. He
quivered; he shivered.</p>
<p>Not for the world would she have spoken to him, realising, from
the familiar signs, his eyes averted, and some curious gathering
together of his person, as if he wrapped himself about and needed
privacy into which to regain his equilibrium, that he was outraged
and anguished. She stroked James's head; she transferred to him
what she felt for her husband, and, as she watched him chalk yellow
the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the Army and Navy Stores
catalogue, thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn
out a great artist; and why should he not? He had a splendid
forehead. Then, looking up, as her husband passed her once more,
she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled; domesticity
triumphed; custom crooned its soothing rhythm, so that when
stopping deliberately, as his turn came round again, at the window
he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle James's bare calf
with a sprig of something, she twitted him for having dispatched
"that poor young man,” Charles Tansley. Tansley had had to go in
and write his dissertation, he said.</p>
<p>“James will have to write HIS dissertation one of these days,"
he added ironically, flicking his sprig.</p>
<p>Hating his father, James brushed away the tickling spray with
which in a manner peculiar to him, compound of severity and humour,
he teased his youngest son's bare leg.</p>
<p>She was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send
to Sorley's little boy tomorrow, said Mrs Ramsay.</p>
<p>There wasn't the slightest possible chance that they could go to
the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mr Ramsay snapped out irascibly.</p>
<p>How did he know? she asked. The wind often changed.</p>
<p>The extraordinary irrationality of her remark, the folly of
women's minds enraged him. He had ridden through the valley of
death, been shattered and shivered; and now, she flew in the face
of facts, made his children hope what was utterly out of the
question, in effect, told lies. He stamped his foot on the stone
step. "Damn you,” he said. But what had she said? Simply that it
might be fine tomorrow. So it might.</p>
<p>Not with the barometer falling and the wind due west.</p>
<p>To pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for
other people's feelings, to rendthe thin veils of civilization so
wantonly, so brutally, was to her so horrible an outrage of human
decency that, without replying, dazed and blinded, she bent her
head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail, the drench of dirty
water, bespatter her unrebuked. There was nothing to be said.</p>
<p>He stood by her in silence. Very humbly, at length, he said that
he would step over and ask the Coastguards if she liked.</p>
<p>There was nobody whom she reverenced as she reverenced him.</p>
<p>She was quite ready to take his word for it, she said. Only then
they need not cut sandwiches—that was all. They came to her,
naturally, since she was a woman, all day long with this and that;
one wanting this, another that; the children were growing up; she
often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human
emotions. Then he said, Damn you. He said, It must rain. He said,
It won't rain; and instantly a Heaven of security opened before
her. There was nobody she reverenced more. She was not good enough
to tie his shoe strings, she felt.</p>
<p>Already ashamed of that petulance, of that gesticulation of the
hands when charging at the head of his troops, Mr Ramsay rather
sheepishly prodded his son's bare legs once more, and then, as if
he had her leave for it, with a movement which oddly reminded his
wife of the great sea lion at the Zoo tumbling backwards after
swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank
washes from side to side, he dived into the evening air which,
already thinner, was taking the substance from leaves and hedges
but, as if in return, restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which
they had not had by day.</p>
<p>“Some one had blundered,” he said again, striding off, up and
down the terrace.</p>
<p>But how extraordinarily his note had changed! It was like the
cuckoo; "in June he gets out of tune"; as if he were trying over,
tentatively seeking, some phrase for a new mood, and having only
this at hand, used it, cracked though it was. But it sounded
ridiculous—"Some one had blundered"—said like that, almost as a
question, without any conviction, melodiously. Mrs Ramsay could not
help smiling, and soon, sure enough, walking up and down, he hummed
it, dropped it, fell silent.</p>
<p>He was safe, he was restored to his privacy. He stopped to light
his pipe, looked once at his wife and son in the window, and as one
raises one's eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm,
a tree, a cluster of cottages as an illustration, a confirmation of
something on the printed page to which one returns, fortified, and
satisfied, so without his distinguishing either his son or his
wife, the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and
consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding
of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid
mind.</p>
<p>It was a splendid mind. For if thought is like the keyboard of a
piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged
in twenty-six letters all in order, then his splendid mind had no
sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one, firmly
and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q. He reached
Q. Very few people in the whole of England ever reach Q. Here,
stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums,
he saw, but now far, far away, like children picking up shells,
divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet
and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived,
his wife and son, together, in the window. They needed his
protection; he gave it them. But after Q? What comes next? After Q
there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible
to mortal eyes, but glimmers red in the distance. Z is only reached
once by one man in a generation. Still, if he could reach R it
would be something. Here at least was Q. He dug his heels in at Q.
Q he was sure of. Q he could demonstrate. If Q then is Q—R—. Here
he knocked his pipe out, with two or three resonant taps on the
handle of the urn, and proceeded. "Then R… ” He braced himself. He
clenched himself.</p>
<p>Qualities that would have saved a ship's company exposed on a
broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of water—endurance and
justice, foresight, devotion, skill, came to his help. R is
then—what is R?</p>
<p>A shutter, like the leathern eyelid of a lizard, flickered over
the intensity of his gaze and obscured the letter R. In that flash
of darkness he heard people saying—he was a failure—that R was
beyond him. He would never reach R. On to R, once more. R—</p>
<p>Qualities that in a desolate expedition across the icy solitudes
of the Polar region would have made him the leader, the guide, the
counsellor, whose temper, neither sanguine nor despondent, surveys
with equanimity what is to be and faces it, came to his help again.
R—</p>
<p>The lizard's eye flickered once more. The veins on his forehead
bulged. The geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and,
displayed among its leaves, he could see, without wishing it, that
old, that obvious distinction between the two classes of men; on
the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who, plodding
and persevering, repeat the whole alphabet in order, twenty-six
letters in all, from start to finish; on the other the gifted, the
inspired who, miraculously, lump all the letters together in one
flash—the way of genius. He had not genius; he laid no claim to
that: but he had, or might have had, the power to repeat every
letter of the alphabet from A to Z accurately in order. Meanwhile,
he stuck at Q. On, then, on to R.</p>
<p>Feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who, now that
the snow has begun to fall and the mountain top is covered in mist,
knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes,
stole upon him, paling the colour of his eyes, giving him, even in
the two minutes of his turn on the terrace, the bleached look of
withered old age. Yet he would not die lying down; he would find
some crag of rock, and there, his eyes fixed on the storm, trying
to the end to pierce the darkness, he would die standing. He would
never reach R.</p>
<p>He stood stock-still, by the urn, with the geranium flowing over
it. How many men in a thousand million, he asked himself, reach Z
after all? Surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself
that, and answer, without treachery to the expedition behind him,
"One perhaps.” One in a generation. Is he to be blamed then if he
is not that one? provided he has toiled honestly, given to the best
of his power, and till he has no more left to give? And his fame
lasts how long? It is permissible even for a dying hero to think
before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter. His fame lasts
perhaps two thousand years. And what are two thousand years? (asked
Mr Ramsay ironically, staring at the hedge). What, indeed, if you
look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages? The very
stone one kicks with one's boot will outlast Shakespeare. His own
little light would shine, not very brightly, for a year or two, and
would then be merged in some bigger light, and that in a bigger
still. (He looked into the hedge, into the intricacy of the twigs.)
Who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after
all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the
perishing of the stars, if before death stiffens his limbs beyond
the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed
fingers to his brow, and square his shoulders, so that when the
search party comes they will find him dead at his post, the fine
figure of a soldier? Mr Ramsay squared his shoulders and stood very
upright by the urn.</p>
<p>Who shall blame him, if, so standing for a moment he dwells upon
fame, upon search parties, upon cairns raised by grateful followers
over his bones? Finally, who shall blame the leader of the doomed
expedition, if, having adventured to the uttermost, and used his
strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring
if he wakes or not, he now perceives by some pricking in his toes
that he lives, and does not on the whole object to live, but
requires sympathy, and whisky, and some one to tell the story of
his suffering to at once? Who shall blame him? Who will not
secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off, and halts by
the window and gazes at his wife and son, who, very distant at
first, gradually come closer and closer, till lips and book and
head are clearly before him, though still lovely and unfamiliar
from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the
perishing of the stars, and finally putting his pipe in his pocket
and bending his magnificent head before her—who will blame him if
he does homage to the beauty of the world?</p>
