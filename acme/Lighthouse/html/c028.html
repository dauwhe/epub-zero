<p>Thinking no harm, for the family would not come, never again,
some said, and the house would be sold at Michaelmas perhaps, Mrs
McNab stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her.
She laid them on the table while she dusted. She was fond of
flowers. It was a pity to let them waste. Suppose the house were
sold (she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking-glass) it would
want seeing to—it would. There it had stood all these years without
a soul in it. The books and things were mouldy, for, what with the
war and help being hard to get, the house had not been cleaned as
she could have wished. It was beyond one person's strength to get
it straight now. She was too old. Her legs pained her. All those
books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun; there was
plaster fallen in the hall; the rain-pipe had blocked over the
study window and let the water in; the carpet was ruined quite. But
people should come themselves; they should have sent somebody down
to see. For there were clothes in the cupboards; they had left
clothes in all the bedrooms. What was she to do with them? They had
the moth in them—Mrs Ramsay's things. Poor lady! She would never
want THEM again. She was dead, they said; years ago, in London.
There was the old grey cloak she wore gardening (Mrs McNab fingered
it). She could see her, as she came up the drive with the washing,
stooping over her flowers (the garden was a pitiful sight now, all
run to riot, and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds)—she
could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak.
There were boots and shoes; and a brush and comb left on the
dressing-table, for all the world as if she expected to come back
tomorrow. (She had died very sudden at the end, they said.) And
once they had been coming, but had put off coming, what with the
war, and travel being so difficult these days; they had never come
all these years; just sent her money; but never wrote, never came,
and expected to find things as they had left them, ah, dear! Why
the dressing-table drawers were full of things (she pulled them
open), handkerchiefs, bits of ribbon. Yes, she could see Mrs Ramsay
as she came up the drive with the washing.</p>
<p>“Good-evening, Mrs McNab,” she would say.</p>
<p>She had a pleasant way with her. The girls all liked her. But,
dear, many things had changed since then (she shut the drawer);
many families had lost their dearest. So she was dead; and Mr
Andrew killed; and Miss Prue dead too, they said, with her first
baby; but everyone had lost some one these years. Prices had gone
up shamefully, and didn't come down again neither. She could well
remember her in her grey cloak.</p>
<p>“Good-evening, Mrs McNab,” she said, and told cook to keep a
plate of milk soup for her—quite thought she wanted it, carrying
that heavy basket all the way up from town. She could see her now,
stooping over her flowers; and faint and flickering, like a yellow
beam or the circle at the end of a telescope, a lady in a grey
cloak, stooping over her flowers, went wandering over the bedroom
wall, up the dressing-table, across the wash-stand, as Mrs McNab
hobbled and ambled, dusting, straightening. And cook's name now?
Mildred? Marian?—some name like that. Ah, she had forgotten—she did
forget things. Fiery, like all red-haired women. Many a laugh they
had had. She was always welcome in the kitchen. She made them
laugh, she did. Things were better then than now.</p>
<p>She sighed; there was too much work for one woman. She wagged
her head this side and that. This had been the nursery. Why, it was
all damp in here; the plaster was falling. Whatever did they want
to hang a beast's skull there? gone mouldy too. And rats in all the
attics. The rain came in. But they never sent; never came. Some of
the locks had gone, so the doors banged. She didn't like to be up
here at dusk alone neither. It was too much for one woman, too
much, too much. She creaked, she moaned. She banged the door. She
turned the key in the lock, and left the house alone, shut up,
locked.</p>
