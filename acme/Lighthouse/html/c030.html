<p>Then indeed peace had come. Messages of peace breathed from the
sea to the shore. Never to break its sleep any more, to lull it
rather more deeply to rest, and whatever the dreamers dreamt
holily, dreamt wisely, to confirm—what else was it murmuring—as
Lily Briscoe laid her head on the pillow in the clean still room
and heard the sea. Through the open window the voice of the beauty
of the world came murmuring, too softly to hear exactly what it
said—but what mattered if the meaning were plain? entreating the
sleepers (the house was full again; Mrs Beckwith was staying there,
also Mr Carmichael), if they would not actually come down to the
beach itself at least to lift the blind and look out. They would
see then night flowing down in purple; his head crowned; his
sceptre jewelled; and how in his eyes a child might look. And if
they still faltered (Lily was tired out with travelling and slept
almost at once; but Mr Carmichael read a book by candlelight), if
they still said no, that it was vapour, this splendour of his, and
the dew had more power than he, and they preferred sleeping; gently
then without complaint, or argument, the voice would sing its song.
Gently the waves would break (Lily heard them in her sleep);
tenderly the light fell (it seemed to come through her eyelids).
And it all looked, Mr Carmichael thought, shutting his book,
falling asleep, much as it used to look.</p>
<p>Indeed the voice might resume, as the curtains of dark wrapped
themselves over the house, over Mrs Beckwith, Mr Carmichael, and
Lily Briscoe so that they lay with several folds of blackness on
their eyes, why not accept this, be content with this, acquiesce
and resign? The sigh of all the seas breaking in measure round the
isles soothed them; the night wrapped them; nothing broke their
sleep, until, the birds beginning and the dawn weaving their thin
voices in to its whiteness, a cart grinding, a dog somewhere
barking, the sun lifted the curtains, broke the veil on their eyes,
and Lily Briscoe stirring in her sleep. She clutched at her
blankets as a faller clutches at the turf on the edge of a cliff.
Her eyes opened wide. Here she was again, she thought, sitting bold
upright in bed. Awake.</p>
