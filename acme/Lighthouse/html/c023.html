<p>But what after all is one night? A short space, especially when
the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows,
or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of
the wave. Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter holds a
pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with
indefatigable fingers. They lengthen; they darken. Some of them
hold aloft clear planets, plates of brightness. The autumn trees,
ravaged as they are, take on the flash of tattered flags kindling
in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble
pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far
away in Indian sands. The autumn trees gleam in the yellow
moonlight, in the light of harvest moons, the light which mellows
the energy of labour, and smooths the stubble, and brings the wave
lapping blue to the shore.</p>
<p>It seemed now as if, touched by human penitence and all its
toil, divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind
it, single, distinct, the hare erect; the wave falling; the boat
rocking; which, did we deserve them, should be ours always. But
alas, divine goodness, twitching the cord, draws the curtain; it
does not please him; he covers his treasures in a drench of hail,
and so breaks them, so confuses them that it seems impossible that
their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from
their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the
clear words of truth. For our penitence deserves a glimpse only;
our toil respite only.</p>
<p>The nights now are full of wind and destruction; the trees
plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn
is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke
rain pipes and scatter damp paths. Also the sea tosses itself and
breaks itself, and should any sleeper fancying that he might find
on the beach an answer to his doubts, a sharer of his solitude,
throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the
sand, no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude
comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the
world reflect the compass of the soul. The hand dwindles in his
hand; the voice bellows in his ear. Almost it would appear that it
is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to
what, and why, and wherefore, which tempt the sleeper from his bed
to seek an answer.</p>
<p>[Mr Ramsay, stumbling along a passage one dark morning,
stretched his arms out, but Mrs Ramsay having died rather suddenly
the night before, his arms, though stretched out, remained
empty.]]</p>
