<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
</div>


<p>Night after night, summer and winter, the torment of storms, the
arrow-like stillness of fine (had there been any one to listen)
from the upper rooms of the empty house only gigantic chaos
streaked with lightning could have been heard tumbling and tossing,
as the winds and waves disported themselves like the amorphous
bulks of leviathans whose brows are pierced by no light of reason,
and mounted one on top of another, and lunged and plunged in the
darkness or the daylight (for night and day, month and year ran
shapelessly together) in idiot games, until it seemed as if the
universe were battling and tumbling, in brute confusion and wanton
lust aimlessly by itself.</p>
<p>In spring the garden urns, casually filled with wind-blown
plants, were gay as ever. Violets came and daffodils. But the
stillness and the brightness of the day were as strange as the
chaos and tumult of night, with the trees standing there, and the
flowers standing there, looking before them, looking up, yet
beholding nothing, eyeless, and so terrible.</p>
