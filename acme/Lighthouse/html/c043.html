<h1>Chapter 13</h1>
</div>


<p>Mr Ramsay had almost done reading. One hand hovered over the
page as if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had
finished it. He sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair
about, extraordinarily exposed to everything. He looked very old.
He looked, James thought, getting his head now against the
Lighthouse, now against the waste of waters running away into the
open, like some old stone lying on the sand; he looked as if he had
become physically what was always at the back of both of their
minds—that loneliness which was for both of them the truth about
things.</p>
<p>He was reading very quickly, as if he were eager to get to the
end. Indeed they were very close to the Lighthouse now. There it
loomed up, stark and straight, glaring white and black, and one
could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass
upon the rocks. One could see lines and creases in the rocks. One
could see the windows clearly; a dab of white on one of them, and a
little tuft of green on the rock. A man had come out and looked at
them through a glass and gone in again. So it was like that, James
thought, the Lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these
years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock. It satisfied him. It
confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character. The
old ladies, he thought, thinking of the garden at home, went
dragging their chairs about on the lawn. Old Mrs Beckwith, for
example, was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and
how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy, but as
a matter of fact, James thought, looking at the Lighthouse stood
there on its rock, it's like that. He looked at his father reading
fiercely with his legs curled tight. They shared that knowledge.
"We are driving before a gale—we must sink,” he began saying to
himself, half aloud, exactly as his father said it.</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to have spoken for an age. Cam was tired of
looking at the sea. Little bits of black cork had floated past; the
fish were dead in the bottom of the boat. Still her father read,
and James looked at him and she looked at him, and they vowed that
they would fight tyranny to the death, and he went on reading quite
unconscious of what they thought. It was thus that he escaped, she
thought. Yes, with his great forehead and his great nose, holding
his little mottled book firmly in front of him, he escaped. You
might try to lay hands on him, but then like a bird, he spread his
wings, he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far
away on some desolate stump. She gazed at the immense expanse of
the sea. The island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like
a leaf any longer. It looked like the top of a rock which some wave
bigger than the rest would cover. Yet in its frailty were all those
paths, those terraces, those bedrooms— all those innumberable
things. But as, just before sleep, things simplify themselves so
that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself,
so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island, all those paths and
terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing, and nothing was
left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that
across her mind. It was a hanging garden; it was a valley, full of
birds, and flowers, and antelopes… She was falling asleep.</p>
<p>“Come now,” said Mr Ramsay, suddenly shutting his book.</p>
<p>Come where? To what extraordinary adventure? She woke with a
start. To land somewhere, to climb somewhere? Where was he leading
them? For after his immense silence the words startled them. But it
was absurd. He was hungry, he said. It was time for lunch. Besides,
look, he said. "There's the Lighthouse. We're almost there.”</p>
<p>“He's doing very well,” said Macalister, praising James. "He's
keeping her very steady.”</p>
<p>But his father never praised him, James thought grimly.</p>
<p>Mr Ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among
them. Now he was happy, eating bread and cheese with these
fishermen. He would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge
about in the harbour spitting with the other old men, James
thought, watching him slice his cheese into thin yellow sheets with
his penknife.</p>
<p>This is right, this is it, Cam kept feeling, as she peeled her
hard- boiled egg. Now she felt as she did in the study when the old
men were reading THE TIMES. Now I can go on thinking whatever I
like, and I shan't fall over a precipice or be drowned, for there
he is, keeping his eye on me, she thought.</p>
<p>At the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks
that it was very exciting—it seemed as if they were doing two
things at once; they were eating their lunch here in the sun and
they were also making for safety in a great storm after a
shipwreck. Would the water last? Would the provisions last? she
asked herself, telling herself a story but knowing at the same time
what was the truth.</p>
<p>They would soon be out of it, Mr Ramsay was saying to old
Macalister; but their children would see some strange things.
Macalister said he was seventy-five last March; Mr Ramsay was
seventy-one. Macalister said he had never seen a doctor; he had
never lost a tooth. And that's the way I'd like my children to
live—Cam was sure that her father was thinking that, for he stopped
her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her, as if he were
thinking of the fishermen and how they lived, that if she did not
want it she should put it back in the parcel. She should not waste
it. He said it so wisely, as if he knew so well all the things that
happened in the world that she put it back at once, and then he
gave her, from his own parcel, a gingerbread nut, as if he were a
great Spanish gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lady at
a window (so courteous his manner was). He was shabby, and simple,
eating bread and cheese; and yet he was leading them on a great
expedition where, for all she knew, they would be drowned.</p>
<p>“That was where she sunk,” said Macalister's boy suddenly.</p>
<p>Three men were drowned where we are now, the old man said. He
had seen them clinging to the mast himself. And Mr Ramsay taking a
look at the spot was about, James and Cam were afraid, to burst
out:</p>
<p>But I beneath a rougher sea,</p>
<p>and if he did, they could not bear it; they would shriek aloud;
they could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled
in him; but to their surprise all he said was "Ah” as if he thought
to himself. But why make a fuss about that? Naturally men are
drowned in a storm, but it is a perfectly straightforward affair,
and the depths of the sea (he sprinkled the crumbs from his
sandwich paper over them) are only water after all. Then having
lighted his pipe he took out his watch. He looked at it
attentively; he made, perhaps, some mathematical calculation. At
last he said, triumphantly:</p>
<p>“Well done!” James had steered them like a born sailor.</p>
<p>There! Cam thought, addressing herself silently to James. You've
got it at last. For she knew that this was what James had been
wanting, and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that
he would not look at her or at his father or at any one. There he
sat with his hand on the tiller sitting bolt upright, looking
rather sulky and frowning slightly. He was so pleased that he was
not going to let anybody share a grain of his pleasure. His father
had praised him. They must think that he was perfectly indifferent.
But you've got it now, Cam thought.</p>
<p>They had tacked, and they were sailing swiftly, buoyantly on
long rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an
extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef. On the left a
row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and
became greener and on one, a higher rock, a wave incessantly broke
and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower.
One could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling
drops and a kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves
rolling and gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were wild
creatures who were perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and
sported like this for ever.</p>
<p>Now they could see two men on the Lighthouse, watching them and
making ready to meet them.</p>
<p>Mr Ramsay buttoned his coat, and turned up his trousers. He took
the large, badly packed, brown paper parcel which Nancy had got
ready and sat with it on his knee. Thus in complete readiness to
land he sat looking back at the island. With his long-sighted eyes
perhaps he could see the dwindled leaf-like shape standing on end
on a plate of gold quite clearly. What could he see? Cam wondered.
It was all a blur to her. What was he thinking now? she wondered.
What was it he sought, so fixedly, so intently, so silently? They
watched him, both of them, sitting bareheaded with his parcel on
his knee staring and staring at the frail blue shape which seemed
like the vapour of something that had burnt itself away. What do
you want? they both wanted to ask. They both wanted to say, Ask us
anything and we will give it you. But he did not ask them anything.
He sat and looked at the island and he might be thinking, We
perished, each alone, or he might be thinking, I have reached it. I
have found it; but he said nothing.</p>
<p>Then he put on his hat.</p>
<p>“Bring those parcels,” he said, nodding his head at the things
Nancy had done up for them to take to the Lighthouse. "The parcels
for the Lighthouse men,” he said. He rose and stood in the bow of
the boat, very straight and tall, for all the world, James thought,
as if he were saying, "There is no God,” and Cam thought, as if he
were leaping into space, and they both rose to follow him as he
sprang, lightly like a young man, holding his parcel, on to the
rock.</p>
