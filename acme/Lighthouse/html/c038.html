<p>“Mrs Ramsay!” Lily cried, "Mrs Ramsay!” But nothing happened.
The pain increased. That anguish could reduce one to such a pitch
of imbecility, she thought! Anyhow the old man had not heard her.
He remained benignant, calm—if one chose to think it, sublime.
Heaven be praised, no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry,
stop pain, stop! She had not obviously taken leave of her senses.
No one had seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of
annihilation. She remained a skimpy old maid, holding a
paint-brush.</p>
<p>And now slowly the pain of the want, and the bitter anger (to be
called back, just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for
Mrs Ramsay again. Had she missed her among the coffee cups at
breakfast? not in the least) lessened; and of their anguish left,
as antidote, a relief that was balm in itself, and also, but more
mysteriously, a sense of some one there, of Mrs Ramsay, relieved
for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her, staying
lightly by her side and then (for this was Mrs Ramsay in all her
beauty) raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with
which she went. Lily squeezed her tubes again. She attacked that
problem of the hedge. It was strange how clearly she saw her,
stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds,
purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinth or lilies, she
vanished. It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days after
she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting her
wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her
companion, a shade across the fields. The sight, the phrase, had
its power to console. Wherever she happened to be, painting, here,
in the country or in London, the vision would come to her, and her
eyes, half closing, sought something to base her vision on. She
looked down the railway carriage, the omnibus; took a line from
shoulder or cheek; looked at the windows opposite; at Piccadilly,
lamp-strung in the evening. All had been part of the fields of
death. But always something—it might be a face, a voice, a paper
boy crying STANDARD, NEWS—thrust through, snubbed her, waked her,
required and got in the end an effort of attention, so that the
vision must be perpetually remade. Now again, moved as she was by
some instinctive need of distance and blue, she looked at the bay
beneath her, making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves, and
stony fields of the purpler spaces, again she was roused as usual
by something incongruous. There was a brown spot in the middle of
the bay. It was a boat. Yes, she realised that after a second. But
whose boat? Mr Ramsay's boat, she replied. Mr Ramsay; the man who
had marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at the head of a
procession, in his beautiful boots, asking her for sympathy, which
she had refused. The boat was now half way across the bay.</p>
<p>So fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and
there that the sea and sky looked all one fabric, as if sails were
stuck high up in the sky, or the clouds had dropped down into the
sea. A steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll
of smoke which stayed there curving and circling decoratively, as
if the air were a fine gauze which held things and kept them softly
in its mesh, only gently swaying them this way and that. And as
happens sometimes when the weather is very fine, the cliffs looked
as if they were conscious of the ships, and the ships looked as if
they were conscious of the cliffs, as if they signalled to each
other some message of their own. For sometimes quite close to the
shore, the Lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an enormous
distance away.</p>
<p>“Where are they now?” Lily thought, looking out to sea. Where
was he, that very old man who had gone past her silently, holding a
brown paper parcel under his arm? The boat was in the middle of the
bay.</p>
