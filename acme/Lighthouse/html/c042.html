<h1>Chapter 12</h1>
</div>


<p>So much depends then, thought Lily Briscoe, looking at the sea
which had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails
and the clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she
thought, upon distance: whether people are near us or far from us;
for her feeling for Mr Ramsay changed as he sailed further and
further across the bay. It seemed to be elongated, stretched out;
he seemed to become more and more remote. He and his children
seemed to be swallowed up in that blue, that distance; but here, on
the lawn, close at hand, Mr Carmichael suddenly grunted. She
laughed. He clawed his book up from the grass. He settled into his
chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster. That was
different altogether, because he was so near. And now again all was
quiet. They must be out of bed by this time, she supposed, looking
at the house, but nothing appeared there. But then, she remembered,
they had always made off directly a meal was over, on business of
their own. It was all in keeping with this silence, this emptiness,
and the unreality of the early morning hour. It was a way things
had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a moment and looking at
the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke: they
became illness, before habits had spun themselves across the
surface, one felt that same unreality, which was so startling; felt
something emerge. Life was most vivid then. One could be at one's
ease. Mercifully one need not say, very briskly, crossing the lawn
to greet old Mrs Beckwith, who would be coming out to find a corner
to sit in, "Oh, good-morning, Mrs Beckwith! What a lovely day! Are
you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun? Jasper's hidden the
chairs. Do let me find you one!” and all the rest of the usual
chatter. One need not speak at all. One glided, one shook one's
sails (there was a good deal of movement in the bay, boats were
starting off) between things, beyond things. Empty it was not, but
full to the brim. She seemed to be standing up to the lips in some
substance, to move and float and sink in it, yes, for these waters
were unfathomably deep. Into them had spilled so many lives. The
Ramsays'; the children's; and all sorts of waifs and strays of
things besides. A washer-woman with her basket; a rook, a red-hot
poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers: some common feeling
which held the whole together.</p>
<p>It was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which, ten
years ago, standing almost where she stood now, had made her say
that she must be in love with the place. Love had a thousand
shapes. There might be lovers whose gift it was to choose out the
elements of things and place them together and so, giving them a
wholeness not theirs in life, make of some scene, or meeting of
people (all now gone and separate), one of those globed compacted
things over which thought lingers, and love plays.</p>
<p>Her eyes rested on the brown speck of Mr Ramsay's sailing boat.
They would be at the Lighthouse by lunch time she supposed. But the
wind had freshened, and, as the sky changed slightly and the sea
changed slightly and the boats altered their positions, the view,
which a moment before had seemed miraculously fixed, was now
unsatisfactory. The wind had blown the trail of smoke about; there
was something displeasing about the placing of the ships.</p>
<p>The disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own
mind. She felt an obscure distress. It was confirmed when she
turned to her picture. She had been wasting her morning. For
whatever reason she could not achieve that razor edge of balance
between two opposite forces; Mr Ramsay and the picture; which was
necessary. There was something perhaps wrong with the design? Was
it, she wondered, that the line of the wall wanted breaking, was it
that the mass of the trees was too heavy? She smiled ironically;
for had she not thought, when she began, that she had solved her
problem?</p>
<p>What was the problem then? She must try to get hold of something
tht evaded her. It evaded her when she thought of Mrs Ramsay; it
evaded her now when she thought of her picture. Phrases came.
Visions came. Beautiful pictures. Beautiful phrases. But what she
wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves, the thing
itself before it has been made anything. Get that and start afresh;
get that and start afresh; she said desperately, pitching herself
firmly again before her easel. It was a miserable machine, an
inefficient machine, she thought, the human apparatus for painting
or for feeling; it always broke down at the critical moment;
heroically, one must force it on. She stared, frowning. There was
the hedge, sure enough. But one got nothing by soliciting urgently.
One got only a glare in the eye from looking at the line of the
wall, or from thinking—she wore a grey hat. She was astonishingly
beautiful. Let it come, she thought, if it will come. For there are
moments when one can neither think nor feel. And if one can neither
think nor feel, she thought, where is one?</p>
<p>Here on the grass, on the ground, she thought, sitting down, and
examining with her brush a little colony of plantains. For the lawn
was very rough. Here sitting on the world, she thought, for she
could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this
morning was happening for the first time, perhaps for the last
time, as a traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking
out of the train window, that he must look now, for he will never
see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the
fields, again. The lawn was the world; they were up here together,
on this exalted station, she thought, looking at old Mr Carmichael,
who seemed (though they had not said a word all this time) to share
her thoughts. And she would never see him again perhaps. He was
growing old. Also, she remembered, smiling at the slipper that
dangled from his foot, he was growing famous. People said that his
poetry was "so beautiful.” They went and published things he had
written forty years ago. There was a famous man now called
Carmichael, she smiled, thinking how many shapes one person might
wear, how he was that in the newspapers, but here the same as he
had always been. He looked the same—greyer, rather. Yes, he looked
the same, but somebody had said, she recalled, that when he had
heard of Andrew Ramsay's death (he was killed in a second by a
shell; he should have been a great mathematician) Mr Carmichael had
"lost all interest in life.” What did it mean—that? she wondered.
Had he marched through Trafalgar Square grasping a big stick? Had
he turned pages over and over, without reading them, sitting in his
room in St. John's Wood alone? She did not know what he had done,
when he heard that Andrew was killed, but she felt it in him all
the same. They only mumbled at each other on staircases; they
looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it won't be fine.
But this was one way of knowing people, she thought: to know the
outline, not the detail, to sit in one's garden and look at the
slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather. She
knew him in that way. She knew that he had changed somehow. She had
never read a line of his poetry. She thought that she knew how it
went though, slowly and sonorously. It was seasoned and mellow. It
was about the desert and the camel. It was about the palm tree and
the sunset. It was extremely impersonal; it said something about
death; it said very little about love. There was an impersonality
about him. He wanted very little of other people. Had he not always
lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing-room window with some
newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid Mrs Ramsay whom for some
reason he did not much like? On that account, of course, she would
always try to make him stop. He would bow to her. He would halt
unwillingly and bow profoundly. Annoyed that he did not want
anything of her, Mrs Ramsay would ask him (Lily could hear her)
wouldn't he like a coat, a rug, a newspaper? No, he wanted nothing.
(Here he bowed.) There was some quality in her which he did not
much like. It was perhaps her masterfulness, her positiveness,
something matter-of-fact in her. She was so direct.</p>
<p>(A noise drew her attention to the drawing-room window—the
squeak of a hinge. The light breeze was toying with the
window.)</p>
<p>There must have been people who disliked her very much, Lily
thought (Yes; she realised that the drawing-room step was empty,
but it had no effect on her whatever. She did not want Mrs Ramsay
now.)—People who thought her too sure, too drastic.</p>
<p>Also, her beauty offended people probably. How monotonous, they
would say, and the same always! They preferred another type—the
dark, the vivacious. Then she was weak with her husband. She let
him make those scenes. Then she was reserved. Nobody knew exactly
what had happened to her. And (to go back to Mr Carmichael and his
dislike) one could not imagine Mrs Ramsay standing painting, lying
reading, a whole morning on the lawn. It was unthinkable. Without
saying a word, the only token of her errand a basket on her arm,
she went off to the town, to the poor, to sit in some stuffy little
bedroom. Often and often Lily had seen her go silently in the midst
of some game, some discussion, with her basket on her arm, very
upright. She had noted her return. She had thought, half laughing
(she was so methodical with the tea cups), half moved (her beauty
took one's breath away), eyes that are closing in pain have looked
on you. You have been with them there.</p>
<p>And then Mrs Ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late,
or the butter not fresh, or the teapot chipped. And all the time
she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking
of Greek temples, and how beauty had been with them there in that
stuffy little room. She never talked of it—she went, punctually,
directly. It was her instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows
for the south, the artichokes for the sun, turning her infallibly
to the human race, making her nest in its heart. And this, like all
instincts, was a little distressing to people who did not share it;
to Mr Carmichael perhaps, to herself certainly. Some notion was in
both of them about the ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of
thought. Her going was a reproach to them, gave a different twist
to the world, so that they were led to protest, seeing their own
prepossessions disappear, and clutch at them vanishing. Charles
Tansley did that too: it was part of the reason why one disliked
him. He upset the proportions of one's world. And what had happened
to him, she wondered, idly stirring the platains with her brush. He
had got his fellowship. He had married; he lived at Golder's
Green.</p>
<p>She had gone one day into a Hall and heard him speaking during
the war. He was denouncing something: he was condemning somebody.
He was preaching brotherly love. And all she felt was how could he
love his kind who did not know one picture from another, who had
stood behind her smoking shag ("fivepence an ounce, Miss Briscoe")
and making it his business to tell her women can't write, women
can't paint, not so much that he believed it, as that for some odd
reason he wished it? There he was lean and red and raucous,
preaching love from a platform (there were ants crawling about
among the plantains which she disturbed with her brush—red,
energetic, shiny ants, rather like Charles Tansley). She had looked
at him ironically from her seat in the half-empty hall, pumping
love into that chilly space, and suddenly, there was the old cask
or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and Mrs
Ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles. "Oh, dear!
What a nuisance! Lost again. Don't bother, Mr Tansley. I lose
thousands every summer,” at which he pressed his chin back against
his collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could
stand it in her whom he liked, and smiled very charmingly. He must
have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people
got separated and walked back alone. He was educating his little
sister, Mrs Ramsay had told her. It was immensely to his credit.
Her own idea of him was grotesque, Lily knew well, stirring the
plantains with her brush. Half one's notions of other people were,
after all, grotesque. They served private purposes of one's own. He
did for her instead of a whipping-boy. She found herself
flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper. If she
wanted to be serious about him she had to help herself to Mrs
Ramsay's sayings, to look at him through her eyes.</p>
<p>She raised a little mountain for the ants to climb over. She
reduced them to a frenzy of indecision by this interference in
their cosmogony. Some ran this way, others that.</p>
<p>One wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with, she reflected. Fifty
pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with, she
thought. Among them, must be one that was stone blind to her
beauty. One wanted most some secret sense, fine as air, with which
to steal through keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting,
talking, sitting silent in the window alone; which took to itself
and treasured up like the air which held the smoke of the steamer,
her thoughts, her imaginations, her desires. What did the hedge
mean to her, what did the garden mean to her, what did it mean to
her when a wave broke? (Lily looked up, as she had seen Mrs Ramsay
look up; she too heard a wave falling on the beach.) And then what
stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried, "How's
that? How's that?” cricketing? She would stop knitting for a
second. She would look intent. Then she would lapse again, and
suddenly Mr Ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her and
some curious shock passed through her and seemed to rock her in
profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he stood over
her and looked down at her. Lily could see him.</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair. It
seemed somehow as if he had done it before; as if he had once bent
in the same way and raised her from a boat which, lying a few
inches off some island, had required that the ladies should thus be
helped on shore by the gentlemen. An old-fashioned scene that was,
which required, very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers.
Letting herself be helped by him, Mrs Ramsay had thought (Lily
supposed) the time has come now. Yes, she would say it now. Yes,
she would marry him. And she stepped slowly, quietly on shore.
Probably she said one word only, letting her hand rest still in
his. I will marry you, she might have said, with her hand in his;
but no more. Time after time the same thrill had passed between
them—obviously it had, Lily thought, smoothing a way for her ants.
She was not inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something
she had been given years ago folded up; something she had seen. For
in the rough and tumble of daily life, with all those children
about, all those visitors, one had constantly a sense of
repetition—of one thing falling where another had fallen, and so
setting up an echo which chimed in the air and made it full of
vibrations.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake, she thought, thinking how they walked
off together, arm in arm, past the greenhouse, to simplify their
relationship. It was no monotony of bliss—she with her impulses and
quicknesses; he with his shudders and glooms. Oh, no. The bedroom
door would slam violently early in the morning. He would start from
the table in a temper. He would whizz his plate through the window.
Then all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming
and blinds fluttering, as if a gusty wind were blowing and people
scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make
things ship- shape. She had met Paul Rayley like that one day on
the stairs. They had laughed and laughed, like a couple of
children, all because Mr Ramsay, finding an earwig in his milk at
breakfast had sent the whole thing flying through the air on to the
terrace outside. 'An earwig, Prue murmured, awestruck, 'in his
milk.' Other people might find centipedes. But he had built round
him such a fence of sanctity, and occupied the space with such a
demeanour of majesty that an earwig in his milk was a monster.</p>
<p>But it tired Mrs Ramsay, it cowed her a little—the plates
whizzing and the doors slamming. And there would fall between them
sometimes long rigid silences, when, in a state of mind which
annoyed Lily in her, half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed
unable to surmount the tempest calmly, or to laugh as they laughed,
but in her weariness perhaps concealed something. She brooded and
sat silent. After a time he would hang stealthily about the places
where she was—roaming under the window where she sat writing
letters or talking, for she would take care to be busy when he
passed, and evade him, and pretend not to see him. Then he would
turn smooth as silk, affable, urbane, and try to win her so. Still
she would hold off, and now she would assert for a brief season
some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was
generally utterly without; would turn her head; would look so, over
her shoulder, always with some Minta, Paul, or William Bankes at
her side. At length, standing outside the group the very figure of
a famished wolfhound (Lily got up off the grass and stood looking
at the steps, at the window, where she had seen him), he would say
her name, once only, for all the world like a wolf barking in the
snow, but still she held back; and he would say it once more, and
this time something in the tone would rouse her, and she would go
to him, leaving them all of a sudden, and they would walk off
together among the pear trees, the cabbages, and the raspberry
beds. They would have it out together. But with what attitudes and
with what words? Such a dignity was theirs in this relationship
that, turning away, she and Paul and Minta would hide their
curiosity and their discomfort, and begin picking flowers, throwing
balls, chattering, until it was time for dinner, and there they
were, he at one end of the table, she at the other, as usual.</p>
<p>“Why don't some of you take up botany?.. With all those legs and
arms why doesn't one of you… ?” So they would talk as usual,
laughing, among the children. All would be as usual, save only for
some quiver, as of a blade in the air, which came and went between
them as if the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup
plates had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the
pears and the cabbages. Especially, Lily thought, Mrs Ramsay would
glance at Prue. She sat in the middle between brothers and sisters,
always occupied, it seemed, seeing that nothing went wrong so that
she scarcely spoke herself. How Prue must have blamed herself for
that earwig in the milk How white she had gone when Mr Ramsay threw
his plate through the window! How she drooped under those long
silences between them! Anyhow, her mother now would seem to be
making it up to her; assuring her that everything was well;
promising her that one of these days that same happiness would be
hers. She had enjoyed it for less than a year, however.</p>
<p>She had let the flowers fall from her basket, Lily thought,
screwing up her eyes and standing back as if to look at her
picture, which she was not touching, however, with all her
faculties in a trance, frozen over superficially but moving
underneath with extreme speed.</p>
<p>She let her flowers fall from her basket, scattered and tumbled
them on to the grass and, reluctantly and hesitatingly, but without
question or complaint—had she not the faculty of obedience to
perfection?—went too. Down fields, across valleys, white,
flower-strewn—that was how she would have painted it. The hills
were austere. It was rocky; it was steep. The waves sounded hoarse
on the stones beneath. They went, the three of them together, Mrs
Ramsay walking rather fast in front, as if she expected to meet
some one round the corner.</p>
<p>Suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by
some light stuff behind it. At last then somebody had come into the
drawing-room; somebody was sitting in the chair. For Heaven's sake,
she prayed, let them sit still there and not come floundering out
to talk to her. Mercifully, whoever it was stayed still inside; had
settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw an odd-shaped
triangular shadow over the step. It altered the composition of the
picture a little. It was interesting. It might be useful. Her mood
was coming back to her. One must keep on looking without for a
second relaxing the intensity of emotion, the determination not to
be put off, not to be bamboozled. One must hold the scene—so—in a
vise and let nothing come in and spoil it. One wanted, she thought,
dipping her brush deliberately, to be on a level with ordinary
experience, to feel simply that's a chair, that's a table, and yet
at the same time, It's a miracle, it's an ecstasy. The problem
might be solved after all. Ah, but what had happened? Some wave of
white went over the window pane. The air must have stirred some
flounce in the room. Her heart leapt at her and seized her and
tortured her.</p>
<p>“Mrs Ramsay! Mrs Ramsay!” she cried, feeling the old horror come
back—to want and want and not to have. Could she inflict that
still? And then, quietly, as if she refrained, that too became part
of ordinary experience, was on a level with the chair, with the
table. Mrs Ramsay—it was part of her perfect goodness—sat there
quite simply, in the chair, flicked her needles to and fro, knitted
her reddish-brown stocking, cast her shadow on the step. There she
sat.</p>
<p>And as if she had something she must share, yet could hardly
leave her easel, so full her mind was of what she was thinking, of
what she was seeing, Lily went past Mr Carmichael holding her brush
to the edge of the lawn. Where was that boat now? And Mr Ramsay?
She wanted him.</p>
