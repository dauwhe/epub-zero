<h1>Chapter 19</h1>
</div>


<p>Of course, she said to herself, coming into the room, she had to
come here to get something she wanted. First she wanted to sit down
in a particular chair under a particular lamp. But she wanted
something more, though she did not know, could not think what it
was that she wanted. She looked at her husband (taking up her
stocking and beginning to knit), and saw that he did not want to be
interrupted— that was clear. He was reading something that moved
him very much. He was half smiling and then she knew he was
controlling his emotion. He was tossing the pages over. He was
acting it—perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book.
She wondered what book it was. Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter's
she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on
her knitting. For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as
if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above), had
been saying that people don't read Scott any more. Then her husband
thought, "That's what they'll say of me;” so he went and got one of
those books. And if he came to the conclusion "That's true” what
Charles Tansley said, he would accept it about Scott. (She could
see that he was weighing, considering, putting this with that as he
read.) But not about himself. He was always uneasy about himself.
That troubled her. He would always be worrying about his own
books—will they be read, are they good, why aren't they better,
what do people think of me? Not liking to think of him so, and
wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became
irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting, wondering
if the children were laughing at that, she twitched the stockings
out, and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments
about her lips and forehead, and she grew still like a tree which
has been tossing and quivering and now, when the breeze falls,
settles, leaf by leaf, into quiet.</p>
<p>It didn't matter, any of it, she thought. A great man, a great
book, fame—who could tell? She knew nothing about it. But it was
his way with him, his truthfulness—for instance at dinner she had
been thinking quite instinctively, If only he would speak! She had
complete trust in him. And dismissing all this, as one passes in
diving now a weed, now a straw, now a bubble, she felt again,
sinking deeper, as she had felt in the hall when the others were
talking, There is something I want—something I have come to get,
and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was,
with her eyes closed. And she waited a little, knitting, wondering,
and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner, "the China
rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee,” began washing
from side to side of her mind rhythmically, and as they washed,
words, like little shaded lights, one red, one blue, one yellow,
lit up in the dark of her mind, and seemed leaving their perches up
there to fly across and across, or to cry out and to be echoed; so
she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.</p>
<p>And all the lives we ever lived</p>
<p>And all the lives to be,</p>
<p>Are full of trees and changing leaves,</p>
<p>she murmured, sticking her needles into the stocking. And she
opened the book and began reading here and there at random, and as
she did so, she felt that she was climbing backwards, upwards,
shoving her way up under petals that curved over her, so that she
only knew this is white, or this is red. She did not know at first
what the words meant at all.</p>
<p>Steer, hither steer your winged pines, all beaten Mariners</p>
<p>she read and turned the page, swinging herself, zigzagging this
way and that, from one line to another as from one branch to
another, from one red and white flower to another, until a little
sound roused her—her husband slapping his thighs. Their eyes met
for a second; but they did not want to speak to each other. They
had nothing to say, but something seemed, nevertheless, to go from
him to her. It was the life, it was the power of it, it was the
tremendous humour, she knew, that made him slap his thighs. Don't
interrupt me, he seemed to be saying, don't say anything; just sit
there. And he went on reading. His lips twitched. It filled him. It
fortified him. He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the
evening, and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people
ate and drank interminably, and his being so irritable with his
wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as
if they didn't exist at all. But now, he felt, it didn't matter a
damn who reached Z (if thought ran like an alphabet from A to Z).
Somebody would reach it—if not he, then another. This man's
strength and sanity, his feeling for straight forward simple
things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in
Mucklebackit's cottage made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of
something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke
back his tears. Raising the book a little to hide his face, he let
them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself
completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and
French novels and English novels and Scott's hands being tied but
his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own
bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie's drowning and
Mucklebackit's sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the
astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him.</p>
<p>Well, let them improve upon that, he thought as he finished the
chapter. He felt that he had been arguing with somebody, and had
got the better of him. They could not improve upon that, whatever
they might say; and his own position became more secure. The lovers
were fiddlesticks, he thought, collecting it all in his mind again.
That's fiddlesticks, that's first-rate, he thought, putting one
thing beside another. But he must read it again. He could not
remember the whole shape of the thing. He had to keep his judgement
in suspense. So he returned to the other thought—if young men did
not care for this, naturally they did not care for him either. One
ought not to complain, thought Mr Ramsay, trying to stifle his
desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him.
But he was determined; he would not bother her again. Here he
looked at her reading. She looked very peaceful, reading. He liked
to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and
she were alone. The whole of life did not consist in going to bed
with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the
English novel and the French novel.</p>
<p>Mrs Ramsay raised her head and like a person in a light sleep
seemed to say that if he wanted her to wake she would, she really
would, but otherwise, might she go on sleeping, just a little
longer, just a little longer? She was climbing up those branches,
this way and that, laying hands on one flower and then another.</p>
<p>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,</p>
<p>she read, and so reading she was ascending, she felt, on to the
top, on to the summit. How satisfying! How restful! All the odds
and ends of the day stuck to this magnet; her mind felt swept, felt
clean. And then there it was, suddenly entire; she held it in her
hands, beautiful and reasonable, clear and complete, here—the
sonnet.</p>
<p>But she was becoming conscious of her husband looking at her. He
was smiling at her, quizzically, as if he were ridiculing her
gently for being asleep in broad daylight, but at the same time he
was thinking, Go on reading. You don't look sad now, he thought.
And he wondered what she was reading, and exaggerated her
ignorance, her simplicity, for he liked to think that she was not
clever, not book-learned at all. He wondered if she understood what
she was reading. Probably not, he thought. She was astonishingly
beautiful. Her beauty seemed to him, if that were possible, to
increase</p>
<p>Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,</p>
<p>As with your shadow I with these did play,</p>
<p>she finished.</p>
<p>“Well?” she said, echoing his smile dreamily, looking up from
her book.</p>
<p>As with your shadow I with these did play,</p>
<p>she murmured, putting the book on the table.</p>
<p>What had happened, she wondered, as she took up her knitting,
since she had seen him alone? She remembered dressing, and seeing
the moon; Andrew holding his plate too high at dinner; being
depressed by something William had said; the birds in the trees;
the sofa on the landing; the children being awake; Charles Tansley
waking them with his books falling—oh, no, that she had invented;
and Paul having a wash- leather case for his watch. Which should
she tell him about?</p>
<p>“They're engaged,” she said, beginning to knit, "Paul and
Minta.”</p>
<p>“So I guessed,” he said. There was nothing very much to be said
about it. Her mind was still going up and down, up and down with
the poetry; he was still feeling very vigorous, very forthright,
after reading about Steenie's funeral. So they sat silent. Then she
became aware that she wanted him to say something.</p>
<p>Anything, anything, she thought, going on with her knitting.
Anything will do.</p>
<p>“How nice it would be to marry a man with a wash-leather bag for
his watch,” she said, for that was the sort of joke they had
together.</p>
<p>He snorted. He felt about this engagement as he always felt
about any engagement; the girl is much too good for that young man.
Slowly it came into her head, why is it then that one wants people
to marry? What was the value, the meaning of things? (Every word
they said now would be true.) Do say something, she thought,
wishing only to hear his voice. For the shadow, the thing folding
them in was beginning, she felt, to close round her again. Say
anything, she begged, looking at him, as if for help.</p>
<p>He was silent, swinging the compass on his watch-chain to and
fro, and thinking of Scott's novels and Balzac's novels. But
through the crepuscular walls of their intimacy, for they were
drawing together, involuntarily, coming side by side, quite close,
she could feel his mind like a raised hand shadowing her mind; and
he was beginning, now that her thoughts took a turn he
disliked—towards this "pessimism” as he called it—to fidget, though
he said nothing, raising his hand to his forehead, twisting a lock
of hair, letting it fall again.</p>
<p>“You won't finish that stocking tonight,” he said, pointing to
her stocking. That was what she wanted—the asperity in his voice
reproving her. If he says it's wrong to be pessimistic probably it
is wrong, she thought; the marriage will turn out all right.</p>
<p>“No,” she said, flattening the stocking out upon her knee, "I
shan't finish it.”</p>
<p>And what then? For she felt that he was still looking at her,
but that his look had changed. He wanted something—wanted the thing
she always found it so difficult to give him; wanted her to tell
him that she loved him. And that, no, she could not do. He found
talking so much easier than she did. He could say things—she never
could. So naturally it was always he that said the things, and then
for some reason he would mind this suddenly, and would reproach
her. A heartless woman he called her; she never told him that she
loved him. But it was not so—it was not so. It was only that she
never could say what she felt. Was there no crumb on his coat?
Nothing she could do for him? Getting up, she stood at the window
with the reddish-brown stocking in her hands, partly to turn away
from him, partly because she remembered how beautiful it often
is—the sea at night. But she knew that he had turned his head as
she turned; he was watching her. She knew that he was thinking, You
are more beautiful than ever. And she felt herself very beautiful.
Will you not tell me just for once that you love me? He was
thinking that, for he was roused, what with Minta and his book, and
its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about
going to the Lighthouse. But she could not do it; she could not say
it. Then, knowing that he was watching her, instead of saying
anything she turned, holding her stocking, and looked at him. And
as she looked at him she began to smile, for though she had not
said a word, he knew, of course he knew, that she loved him. He
could not deny it. And smiling she looked out of the window and
said (thinking to herself, Nothing on earth can equal this
happiness)—</p>
<p>“Yes, you were right. It's going to be wet tomorrow. You won't
be able to go.” And she looked at him smiling. For she had
triumphed again. She had not said it: yet he knew.</p>
