<p>For Cam grazed the easel by an inch; she would not stop for Mr
Bankes and Lily Briscoe; though Mr Bankes, who would have liked a
daughter of his own, held out his hand; she would not stop for her
father, whom she grazed also by an inch; nor for her mother, who
called "Cam! I want you a moment!” as she dashed past. She was off
like a bird, bullet, or arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by
whom, at what directed, who could say? What, what? Mrs Ramsay
pondered, watching her. It might be a vision—of a shell, of a
wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge; or it
might be the glory of speed; no one knew. But when Mrs Ramsay
called "Cam!” a second time, the projectile dropped in mid career,
and Cam came lagging back, pulling a leaf by the way, to her
mother.</p>
<p>What was she dreaming about, Mrs Ramsay wondered, seeing her
engrossed, as she stood there, with some thought of her own, so
that she had to repeat the message twice—ask Mildred if Andrew,
Miss Doyle, and Mr Rayley have come back?—The words seemed to be
dropped into a well, where, if the waters were clear, they were
also so extraordinarily distorting that, even as they descended,
one saw them twisting about to make Heaven knows what pattern on
the floor of the child's mind. What message would Cam give the
cook? Mrs Ramsay wondered. And indeed it was only by waiting
patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen
with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that Mrs Ramsay
at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up
Mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one
waited, in a colourless singsong. Shifting from foot to foot, Cam
repeated the words, "No, they haven't, and I've told Ellen to clear
away tea.”</p>
<p>Minta Doyle and Paul Rayley had not come back then. That could
only mean, Mrs Ramsay thought, one thing. She must accept him, or
she must refuse him. This going off after luncheon for a walk, even
though Andrew was with them—what could it mean? except that she had
decided, rightly, Mrs Ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond
of Minta), to accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant,
but then, thought Mrs Ramsay, realising that James was tugging at
her, to make her go on reading aloud the Fisherman and his Wife,
she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men
who wrote dissertations; Charles Tansley, for instance. Anyhow it
must have happened, one way or the other, by now.</p>
<p>But she read, "Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was
just daybreak, and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying
before her. Her husband was still stretching himself… ”</p>
<p>But how could Minta say now that she would not have him? Not if
she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country
alone—for Andrew would be off after his crabs—but possibly Nancy
was with them. She tried to recall the sight of them standing at
the hall door after lunch. There they stood, looking at the sky,
wondering about the weather, and she had said, thinking partly to
cover their shyness, partly to encourage them to be off (for her
sympathies were with Paul),</p>
<p>“There isn't a cloud anywhere within miles,” at which she could
feel little Charles Tansley, who had followed them out, snigger.
But she did it on purpose. Whether Nancy was there or not, she
could not be certain, looking from one to the other in her mind's
eye.</p>
<p>She read on: "Ah, wife,” said the man, "why should we be King? I
do not want to be King.” "Well,” said the wife, "if you won't be
King, I will; go to the Flounder, for I will be King.”</p>
<p>“Come in or go out, Cam,” she said, knowing that Cam was
attracted only by the word "Flounder” and that in a moment she
would fidget and fight with James as usual. Cam shot off. Mrs
Ramsay went on reading, relieved, for she and James shared the same
tastes and were comfortable together.</p>
<p>“And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark grey, and the
water heaved up from below, and smelt putrid. Then he went and
stood by it and said,</p>
<p>'Flounder, flounder, in the sea,</p>
<p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
<p>For my wife, good Ilsabil,</p>
<p>Wills not as I'd have her will.'</p>
<p>'Well, what does she want then?' said the Flounder.” And where
were they now? Mrs Ramsay wondered, reading and thinking, quite
easily, both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and
his Wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now
and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody. And when should she
be told? If nothing happened, she would have to speak seriously to
Minta. For she could not go trapesing about all over the country,
even if Nancy were with them (she tried again, unsuccessfully, to
visualize their backs going down the path, and to count them). She
was responsible to Minta's parents—the Owl and the Poker. Her
nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read. The Owl and the
Poker—yes, they would be annoyed if they heard—and they were
certain to hear—that Minta, staying with the Ramsays, had been seen
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. "He wore a wig in the House of
Commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs,” she
repeated, fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which, coming
back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband. Dear,
dear, Mrs Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this
incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her
stocking? How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the
maid was always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had
scattered, and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the
exploits—interesting perhaps, but limited after all—of that bird?
Naturally, one had asked her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay
with them up at Finlay, which had resulted in some friction with
the Owl, her mother, and more calling, and more conversation, and
more sand, and really at the end of it, she had told enough lies
about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said to her
husband that night, coming back from the party). However, Minta
came… Yes, she came, Mrs Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn in
the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this:
a woman had once accused her of "robbing her of her daughter's
affections"; something Mrs Doyle had said made her remember that
charge again. Wishing to dominate, wishing to interfere, making
people do what she wished—that was the charge against her, and she
thought it most unjust. How could she help being "like that” to
look at? No one could accuse her of taking pains to impress. She
was often ashamed of her own shabbiness. Nor was she domineering,
nor was she tyrannical. It was more true about hospitals and drains
and the dairy. About things like that she did feel passionately,
and would, if she had the chance, have liked to take people by the
scruff of their necks and make them see. No hospital on the whole
island. It was a disgrace. Milk delivered at your door in London
positively brown with dirt. It should be made illegal. A model
dairy and a hospital up here—those two things she would have liked
to do, herself. But how? With all these children? When they were
older, then perhaps she would have time; when they were all at
school.</p>
<p>Oh, but she never wanted James to grow a day older! or Cam
either. These two she would have liked to keep for ever just as
they were, demons of wickedness, angels of delight, never to see
them grow up into long-legged monsters. Nothing made up up for the
loss. When she read just now to James, "and there were numbers of
soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets,” and his eyes darkened, she
thought, why should they grow up and lose all that? He was the most
gifted, the most sensitive of her children. But all, she thought,
were full of promise. Prue, a perfect angel with the others, and
sometimes now, at night especially, she took one's breath away with
her beauty. Andrew—even her husband admitted that his gift for
mathematics was extraordinary. And Nancy and Roger, they were both
wild creatures now, scampering about over the country all day long.
As for Rose, her mouth was too big, but she had a wonderful gift
with her hands. If they had charades, Rose made the dresses; made
everything; liked best arranging tables, flowers, anything. She did
not like it that Jasper should shoot birds; but it was only a
stage; they all went through stages. Why, she asked, pressing her
chin on James's head, should they grow up so fast? Why should they
go to school? She would have liked always to have had a baby. She
was happiest carrying one in her arms. Then people might say she
was tyrannical, domineering, masterful, if they chose; she did not
mind. And, touching his hair with her lips, she thought, he will
never be so happy again, but stopped herself, remembering how it
angered her husband that she should say that. Still, it was true.
They were happier now than they would ever be again. A tenpenny tea
set made Cam happy for days. She heard them stamping and crowing on
the floor above her head the moment they awoke. They came bustling
along the passage. Then the door sprang open and in they came,
fresh as roses, staring, wide awake, as if this coming into the
dining-room after breakfast, which they did every day of their
lives, was a positive event to them, and so on, with one thing
after another, all day long, until she went up to say good-night to
them, and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries
and raspberries, still making up stories about some little bit of
rubbish—something they had heard, something they had picked up in
the garden. They all had their little treasures… And so she went
down and said to her husband, Why must they grow up and lose it
all? Never will they be so happy again. And he was angry. Why take
such a gloomy view of life? he said. It is not sensible. For it was
odd; and she believed it to be true; that with all his gloom and
desperation he was happier, more hopeful on the whole, than she
was. Less exposed to human worries—perhaps that was it. He had
always his work to fall back on. Not that she herself was
"pessimistic,” as he accused her of being. Only she thought
life—and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes—her
fifty years. There it was before her—life. Life, she thought—but
she did not finish her thought. She took a look at life, for she
had a clear sense of it there, something real, something private,
which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband. A
sort of transaction went on between them, in which she was on one
side, and life was on another, and she was always trying to get the
better of it, as it was of her; and sometimes they parleyed (when
she sat alone); there were, she remembered, great reconciliation
scenes; but for the most part, oddly enough, she must admit that
she felt this thing that she called life terrible, hostile, and
quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance. There were eternal
problems: suffering; death; the poor. There was always a woman
dying of cancer even here. And yet she had said to all these
children, You shall go through it all. To eight people she had said
relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty
pounds). For that reason, knowing what was before them—love and
ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places—she had often
the feeling, Why must they grow up and lose it all? And then she
said to herself, brandishing her sword at life, Nonsense. They will
be perfectly happy. And here she was, she reflected, feeling life
rather sinister again, making Minta marry Paul Rayley; because
whatever she might feel about her own transaction, she had had
experiences which need not happen to every one (she did not name
them to herself); she was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost
as if it were an escape for her too, to say that people must marry;
people must have children.</p>
<p>Was she wrong in this, she asked herself, reviewing her conduct
for the past week or two, and wondering if she had indeed put any
pressure upon Minta, who was only twenty-four, to make up her mind.
She was uneasy. Had she not laughed about it? Was she not
forgetting again how strongly she influenced people? Marriage
needed—oh, all sorts of qualities (the bill for the greenhouse
would be fifty pounds); one—she need not name it—that was
essential; the thing she had with her husband. Had they that?</p>
<p>“Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman,” she
read. "But outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard
that he could scarcely keep his feet; houses and trees toppled
over, the mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky
was pitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came
in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains, and all
with white foam at the top.”</p>
<p>She turned the page; there were only a few lines more, so that
she would finish the story, though it was past bed-time. It was
getting late. The light in the garden told her that; and the
whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired
together, to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety. What it was about
she could not think at first. Then she remembered; Paul and Minta
and Andrew had not come back. She summoned before her again the
little group on the terrace in front of the hall door, standing
looking up into the sky. Andrew had his net and basket. That meant
he was going to catch crabs and things. That meant he would climb
out on to a rock; he would be cut off. Or coming back single file
on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might
slip. He would roll and then crash. It was growing quite dark.</p>
<p>But she did not let her voice change in the least as she
finished the story, and added, shutting the book, and speaking the
last words as if she had made them up herself, looking into James's
eyes: "And there they are living still at this very time.”</p>
<p>“And that's the end,” she said, and she saw in his eyes, as the
interest of the story died away in them, something else take its
place; something wondering, pale, like the reflection of a light,
which at once made him gaze and marvel. Turning, she looked across
the bay, and there, sure enough, coming regularly across the waves
first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke, was the
light of the Lighthouse. It had been lit.</p>
<p>In a moment he would ask her, "Are we going to the Lighthouse?"
And she would have to say, "No: not tomorrow; your father says
not.” Happily, Mildred came in to fetch them, and the bustle
distracted them. But he kept looking back over his shoulder as
Mildred carried him out, and she was certain that he was thinking,
we are not going to the Lighthouse tomorrow; and she thought, he
will remember that all his life.</p>
