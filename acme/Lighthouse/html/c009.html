<p>Yes, Mr Bankes said, watching him go. It was a thousand pities.
(Lily had said something about his frightening her—he changed from
one mood to another so suddenly.) Yes, said Mr Bankes, it was a
thousand pities that Ramsay could not behave a little more like
other people. (For he liked Lily Briscoe; he could discuss Ramsay
with her quite openly.) It was for that reason, he said, that the
young don't read Carlyle. A crusty old grumbler who lost his temper
if the porridge was cold, why should he preach to us? was what Mr
Bankes understood that young people said nowadays. It was a
thousand pities if you thought, as he did, that Carlyle was one of
the great teachers of mankind. Lily was ashamed to say that she had
not read Carlyle since she was at school. But in her opinion one
liked Mr Ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little
finger ached the whole world must come to an end. It was not THAT
she minded. For who could be deceived by him? He asked you quite
openly to flatter him, to admire him, his little dodges deceived
nobody. What she disliked was his narrowness, his blindness, she
said, looking after him.</p>
<p>“A bit of a hypocrite?” Mr Bankes suggested, looking too at Mr
Ramsay's back, for was he not thinking of his friendship, and of
Cam refusing to give him a flower, and of all those boys and girls,
and his own house, full of comfort, but, since his wife's death,
quiet rather? Of course, he had his work… All the same, he rather
wished Lily to agree that Ramsay was, as he said, "a bit of a
hypocrite.”</p>
<p>Lily Briscoe went on putting away her brushes, looking up,
looking down. Looking up, there he was—Mr Ramsay—advancing towards
them, swinging, careless, oblivious, remote. A bit of a hypocrite?
she repeated. Oh, no—the most sincere of men, the truest (here he
was), the best; but, looking down, she thought, he is absorbed in
himself, he is tyrannical, he is unjust; and kept looking down,
purposely, for only so could she keep steady, staying with the
Ramsays. Directly one looked up and saw them, what she called
"being in love” flooded them. They became part of that unreal but
penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through
the eyes of love. The sky stuck to them; the birds sang through
them. And, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she saw
Mr Ramsay bearing down and retreating, and Mrs Ramsay sitting with
James in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending, how
life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one
lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore
one up and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the
beach.</p>
<p>Mr Bankes expected her to answer. And she was about to say
something criticizing Mrs Ramsay, how she was alarming, too, in her
way, high-handed, or words to that effect, when Mr Bankes made it
entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture. For such it
was considering his age, turned sixty, and his cleanliness and his
impersonality, and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe
him. For him to gaze as Lily saw him gazing at Mrs Ramsay was a
rapture, equivalent, Lily felt, to the loves of dozens of young men
(and perhaps Mrs Ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of
young men). It was love, she thought, pretending to move her
canvas, distilled and filtered; love that never attempted to clutch
its object; but, like the love which mathematicians bear their
symbols, or poets their phrases, was meant to be spread over the
world and become part of the human gain. So it was indeed. The
world by all means should have shared it, could Mr Bankes have said
why that woman pleased him so; why the sight of her reading a fairy
tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the
solution of a scientific problem, so that he rested in
contemplation of it, and felt, as he felt when he had proved
something absolute about the digestive system of plants, that
barbarity was tamed, the reign of chaos subdued.</p>
<p>Such a rapture—for by what other name could one call it?—made
Lily Briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say. It was
nothing of importance; something about Mrs Ramsay. It paled beside
this "rapture,” this silent stare, for which she felt intense
gratitude; for nothing so solaced her, eased her of the perplexity
of life, and miraculously raised its burdens, as this sublime
power, this heavenly gift, and one would no more disturb it, while
it lasted, than break up the shaft of sunlight, lying level across
the floor.</p>
<p>That people should love like this, that Mr Bankes should feel
this for Mrs Ramsey (she glanced at him musing) was helpful, was
exalting. She wiped one brush after another upon a piece of old
rag, menially, on purpose. She took shelter from the reverence
which covered all women; she felt herself praised. Let him gaze;
she would steal a look at her picture.</p>
<p>She could have wept. It was bad, it was bad, it was infinitely
bad! She could have done it differently of course; the colour could
have been thinned and faded; the shapes etherealised; that was how
Paunceforte would have seen it. But then she did not see it like
that. She saw the colour burning on a framework of steel; the light
of a butterfly's wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral. Of all
that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained. And
it would never be seen; never be hung even, and there was Mr
Tansley whispering in her ear, "Women can't paint, women can't
write… ”</p>
<p>She now remembered what she had been going to say about Mrs
Ramsay. She did not know how she would have put it; but it would
have been something critical. She had been annoyed the other night
by some highhandedness. Looking along the level of Mr Bankes's
glance at her, she thought that no woman could worship another
woman in the way he worshipped; they could only seek shelter under
the shade which Mr Bankes extended over them both. Looking along
his beam she added to it her different ray, thinking that she was
unquestionably the loveliest of people (bowed over her book); the
best perhaps; but also, different too from the perfect shape which
one saw there. But why different, and how different? she asked
herself, scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green
which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now, yet she
vowed, she would inspire them, force them to move, flow, do her
bidding tomorrow. How did she differ? What was the spirit in her,
the essential thing, by which, had you found a crumpled glove in
the corner of a sofa, you would have known it, from its twisted
finger, hers indisputably? She was like a bird for speed, an arrow
for directness. She was willful; she was commanding (of course,
Lily reminded herself, I am thinking of her relations with women,
and I am much younger, an insignificant person, living off the
Brompton Road). She opened bedroom windows. She shut doors. (So she
tried to start the tune of Mrs Ramsay in her head.) Arriving late
at night, with a light tap on one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old
fur coat (for the setting of her beauty was always that—hasty, but
apt), she would enact again whatever it might be—Charles Tansley
losing his umbrella; Mr Carmichael snuffling and sniffing; Mr
Bankes saying, "The vegetable salts are lost.” All this she would
adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the
window, in pretence that she must go,—it was dawn, she could see
the sun rising,—half turn back, more intimately, but still always
laughing, insist that she must, Minta must, they all must marry,
since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her
(but Mrs Ramsay cared not a fig for her painting), or triumphs won
by her (probably Mrs Ramsay had had her share of those), and here
she saddened, darkened, and came back to her chair, there could be
no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she lightly took her hand
for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the best of life. The
house seemed full of children sleeping and Mrs Ramsay listening;
shaded lights and regular breathing.</p>
<p>Oh, but, Lily would say, there was her father; her home; even,
had she dared to say it, her painting. But all this seemed so
little, so virginal, against the other. Yet, as the night wore on,
and white lights parted the curtains, and even now and then some
bird chirped in the garden, gathering a desperate courage she would
urge her own exemption from the universal law; plead for it; she
liked to be alone; she liked to be herself; she was not made for
that; and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled
depth, and confront Mrs Ramsay's simple certainty (and she was
childlike now) that her dear Lily, her little Brisk, was a fool.
Then, she remembered, she had laid her head on Mrs Ramsay's lap and
laughed and laughed and laughed, laughed almost hysterically at the
thought of Mrs Ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies
which she completely failed to understand. There she sat, simple,
serious. She had recovered her sense of her now—this was the
glove's twisted finger. But into what sanctuary had one penetrated?
Lily Briscoe had looked up at last, and there was Mrs Ramsay,
unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter, still presiding,
but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished, and in its stead,
something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover—the
little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon.</p>
<p>Was it wisdom? Was it knowledge? Was it, once more, the
deceptiveness of beauty, so that all one's perceptions, half way to
truth, were tangled in a golden mesh? or did she lock up within her
some secret which certainly Lily Briscoe believed people must have
for the world to go on at all? Every one could not be as helter
skelter, hand to mouth as she was. But if they knew, could they
tell one what they knew? Sitting on the floor with her arms round
Mrs Ramsay's knees, close as she could get, smiling to think that
Mrs Ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure, she
imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who
was, physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in
the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if
one could spell them out, would teach one everything, but they
would never be offered openly, never made public. What art was
there, known to love or cunning, by which one pressed through into
those secret chambers? What device for becoming, like waters poured
into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the object one
adored? Could the body achieve, or the mind, subtly mingling in the
intricate passages of the brain? or the heart? Could loving, as
people called it, make her and Mrs Ramsay one? for it was not
knowledge but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets,
nothing that could be written in any language known to men, but
intimacy itself, which is knowledge, she had thought, leaning her
head on Mrs Ramsay's knee.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. Nothing! Nothing! as she leant her head
against Mrs Ramsay's knee. And yet, she knew knowledge and wisdom
were stored up in Mrs Ramsay's heart. How, then, she had asked
herself, did one know one thing or another thing about people,
sealed as they were? Only like a bee, drawn by some sweetness or
sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste, one haunted the
dome-shaped hive, ranged the wastes of the air over the countries
of the world alone, and then haunted the hives with their murmurs
and their stirrings; the hives, which were people. Mrs Ramsay rose.
Lily rose. Mrs Ramsay went. For days there hung about her, as after
a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of,
more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring and, as
she sat in the wicker arm-chair in the drawing-room window she
wore, to Lily's eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome.</p>
<p>This ray passed level with Mr Bankes's ray straight to Mrs
Ramsay sitting reading there with James at her knee. But now while
she still looked, Mr Bankes had done. He had put on his spectacles.
He had stepped back. He had raised his hand. He had slightly
narrowed his clear blue eyes, when Lily, rousing herself, saw what
he was at, and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike
it. She would have snatched her picture off the easel, but she said
to herself, One must. She braced herself to stand the awful trial
of some one looking at her picture. One must, she said, one must.
And if it must be seen, Mr Bankes was less alarming than another.
But that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty-three
years, the deposit of each day's living mixed with something more
secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those
days was an agony. At the same time it was immensely exciting.</p>
<p>Nothing could be cooler and quieter. Taking out a pen-knife, Mr
Bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle. What did she wish to
indicate by the triangular purple shape, "just there"? he
asked.</p>
<p>It was Mrs Ramsay reading to James, she said. She knew his
objection— that no one could tell it for a human shape. But she had
made no attempt at likeness, she said. For what reason had she
introduced them then? he asked. Why indeed?—except that if there,
in that corner, it was bright, here, in this, she felt the need of
darkness. Simple, obvious, commonplace, as it was, Mr Bankes was
interested. Mother and child then—objects of universal veneration,
and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty—might be
reduced, he pondered, to a purple shadow without irreverence.</p>
<p>But the picture was not of them, she said. Or, not in his sense.
There were other senses too in which one might reverence them. By a
shadow here and a light there, for instance. Her tribute took that
form if, as she vaguely supposed, a picture must be a tribute. A
mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence.
A light here required a shadow there. He considered. He was
interested. He took it scientifically in complete good faith. The
truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side, he
explained. The largest picture in his drawing-room, which painters
had praised, and valued at a higher price than he had given for it,
was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the Kennet. He
had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the Kennet, he said. Lily
must come and see that picture, he said. But now—he turned, with
his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas. The
question being one of the relations of masses, of lights and
shadows, which, to be honest, he had never considered before, he
would like to have it explained—what then did she wish to make of
it? And he indicated the scene before them. She looked. She could
not show him what she wished to make of it, could not see it even
herself, without a brush in her hand. She took up once more her old
painting position with the dim eyes and the absent-minded manner,
subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more
general; becoming once more under the power of that vision which
she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and
houses and mothers and children—her picture. It was a question, she
remembered, how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on
the left. She might do it by bringing the line of the branch across
so; or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object (James
perhaps) so. But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the
whole might be broken. She stopped; she did not want to bore him;
she took the canvas lightly off the easel.</p>
<p>But it had been seen; it had been taken from her. This man had
shared with her something profoundly intimate. And, thanking Mr
Ramsay for it and Mrs Ramsay for it and the hour and the place,
crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected—that
one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but
arm in arm with somebody—the strangest feeling in the world, and
the most exhilarating—she nicked the catch of her paint-box to,
more firmly than was necessary, and the nick seemed to surround in
a circle forever the paint-box, the lawn, Mr Bankes, and that wild
villain, Cam, dashing past.</p>
