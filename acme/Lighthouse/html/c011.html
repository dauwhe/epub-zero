<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<p>No, she thought, putting together some of the pictures he had
cut out— a refrigerator, a mowing machine, a gentleman in evening
dress— children never forget. For this reason, it was so important
what one said, and what one did, and it was a relief when they went
to bed. For now she need not think about anybody. She could be
herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need
of—to think; well, not even to think. To be silent; to be alone.
All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal,
evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being
oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to
others. Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was
thus that she felt herself; and this self having shed its
attachments was free for the strangest adventures. When life sank
down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless. And to
everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources, she
supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus Carmichael, must
feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply
childish. Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is
unfathomably deep; but now and again we rise to the surface and
that is what you see us by. Her horizon seemed to her limitless.
There were all the places she had not seen; the Indian plains; she
felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in
Rome. This core of darkness could go anywhere, for no one saw it.
They could not stop it, she thought, exulting. There was freedom,
there was peace, there was, most welcome of all, a summoning
together, a resting on a platform of stability. Not as oneself did
one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here
something dexterous with her needles) but as a wedge of darkness.
Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir; and
there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life
when things came together in this peace, this rest, this eternity;
and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the
Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which
was her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour
one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the
things one saw; and this thing, the long steady stroke, was her
stroke. Often she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and
looking, with her work in her hands until she became the thing she
looked at—that light, for example. And it would lift up on it some
little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like
that—"Children don't forget, children don't forget"—which she would
repeat and begin adding to it, It will end, it will end, she said.
It will come, it will come, when suddenly she added, We are in the
hands of the Lord.</p>
<p>But instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that. Who
had said it? Not she; she had been trapped into saying something
she did not mean. She looked up over her knitting and met the third
stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes,
searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart,
purifying out of existence that lie, any lie. She praised herself
in praising the light, without vanity, for she was stern, she was
searching, she was beautiful like that light. It was odd, she
thought, how if one was alone, one leant to inanimate things;
trees, streams, flowers; felt they expressed one; felt they became
one; felt they knew one, in a sense were one; felt an irrational
tenderness thus (she looked at that long steady light) as for
oneself. There rose, and she looked and looked with her needles
suspended, there curled up off the floor of the mind, rose from the
lake of one's being, a mist, a bride to meet her lover.</p>
<p>What brought her to say that: "We are in the hands of the Lord?"
she wondered. The insincerity slipping in among the truths roused
her, annoyed her. She returned to her knitting again. How could any
Lord have made this world? she asked. With her mind she had always
seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but
suffering, death, the poor. There was no treachery too base for the
world to commit; she knew that. No happiness lasted; she knew that.
She knitted with firm composure, slightly pursing her lips and,
without being aware of it, so stiffened and composed the lines of
her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed,
though he was chuckling at the thought that Hume, the philosopher,
grown enormously fat, had stuck in a bog, he could not help noting,
as he passed, the sternness at the heart of her beauty. It saddened
him, and her remoteness pained him, and he felt, as he passed, that
he could not protect her, and, when he reached the hedge, he was
sad. He could do nothing to help her. He must stand by and watch
her. Indeed, the infernal truth was, he made things worse for her.
He was irritable—he was touchy. He had lost his temper over the
Lighthouse. He looked into the hedge, into its intricacy, its
darkness.</p>
<p>Always, Mrs Ramsay felt, one helped oneself out of solitude
reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end, some sound,
some sight. She listened, but it was all very still; cricket was
over; the children were in their baths; there was only the sound of
the sea. She stopped knitting; she held the long reddish-brown
stocking dangling in her hands a moment. She saw the light again.
With some irony in her interrogation, for when one woke at all,
one's relations changed, she looked at the steady light, the
pitiless, the remorseless, which was so much her, yet so little
her, which had her at its beck and call (she woke in the night and
saw it bent across their bed, stroking the floor), but for all that
she thought, watching it with fascination, hypnotised, as if it
were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her
brain whose bursting would flood her with delight, she had known
happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it silvered
the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and the
blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which
curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst
in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her
mind and she felt, It is enough! It is enough!</p>
<p>He turned and saw her. Ah! She was lovely, lovelier now than
ever he thought. But he could not speak to her. He could not
interrupt her. He wanted urgently to speak to her now that James
was gone and she was alone at last. But he resolved, no; he would
not interrupt her. She was aloof from him now in her beauty, in her
sadness. He would let her be, and he passed her without a word,
though it hurt him that she should look so distant, and he could
not reach her, he could do nothing to help her. And again he would
have passed her without a word had she not, at that very moment,
given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask,
and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame,
and gone to him. For he wished, she knew, to protect her.</p>
