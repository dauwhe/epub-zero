<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<p>They don't feel a thing there, Cam thought, looking at the
shore, which, rising and falling, became steadily more distant and
more peaceful. Her hand cut a trail in the sea, as her mind made
the green swirls and streaks into patterns and, numbed and
shrouded, wandered in imagination in that underworld of waters
where the pearls stuck in clusters to white sprays, where in the
green light a change came over one's entire mind and one's body
shone half transparent enveloped in a green cloak.</p>
<p>Then the eddy slackened round her hand. The rush of the water
ceased; the world became full of little creaking and squeaking
sounds. One heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side
of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour. Everything became
very close to one. For the sail, upon which James had his eyes
fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew, sagged
entirely; there they came to a stop, flapping about waiting for a
breeze, in the hot sun, miles from shore, miles from the
Lighthouse. Everything in the whole world seemed to stand still.
The Lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the distant shore
became fixed. The sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very
close together and to feel each other's presence, which they had
almost forgotten. Macalister's fishing line went plumb down into
the sea. But Mr Ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under
him.</p>
<p>He was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a
plover's egg. Now and again, as they hung about in that horrid
calm, he turned a page. And James felt that each page was turned
with a peculiar gesture aimed at him; now assertively, now
commandingly; now with the intention of making people pity him; and
all the time, as his father read and turned one after another of
those little pages, James kept dreading the moment when he would
look up and speak sharply to him about something or other. Why were
they lagging about here? he would demand, or something quite
unreasonable like that. And if he does, James thought, then I shall
take a knife and strike him to the heart.</p>
<p>He had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and
striking his father to the heart. Only now, as he grew older, and
sat staring at his father in an impotent rage, it was not him, that
old man reading, whom he wanted to kill, but it was the thing that
descended on him—without his knowing it perhaps: that fierce sudden
black-winged harpy, with its talons and its beak all cold and hard,
that struck and struck at you (he could feel the beak on his bare
legs, where it had struck when he was a child) and then made off,
and there he was again, an old man, very sad, reading his book.
That he would kill, that he would strike to the heart. Whatever he
did—(and he might do anything, he felt, looking at the Lighthouse
and the distant shore) whether he was in a business, in a bank, a
barrister, a man at the head of some enterprise, that he would
fight, that he would track down and stamp out—tyranny, despotism,
he called it—making people do what they did not want to do, cutting
off their right to speak. How could any of them say, But I won't,
when he said, Come to the Lighthouse. Do this. Fetch me that. The
black wings spread, and the hard beak tore. And then next moment,
there he sat reading his book; and he might look up—one never
knew—quite reasonably. He might talk to the Macalisters. He might
be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman's hand in the
street, James thought, and he might be shouting out at some
fisherman's sports; he might be waving his arms in the air with
excitement. Or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent
from one end of dinner to the other. Yes, thought James, while the
boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun; there was a waste of
snow and rock very lonely and austere; and there he had come to
feel, quite often lately, when his father said something or did
something which surprised the others, there were two pairs of
footprints only; his own and his father's. They alone knew each
other. What then was this terror, this hatred? Turning back among
the many leaves which the past had folded in him, peering into the
heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other
that all shape is distorted, and one blunders, now with the sun in
one's eyes, now with a dark shadow, he sought an image to cool and
detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape. Suppose then
that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator, or on some
one's knee, he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently,
some one's foot? Suppose he had seen the foot first, in the grass,
smooth, and whole; then the wheel; and the same foot, purple,
crushed. But the wheel was innocent. So now, when his father came
striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to
go to the Lighthouse down it came over his foot, over Cam's foot,
over anybody's foot. One sat and watched it.</p>
<p>But whose foot was he thinking of, and in what garden did all
this happen? For one had settings for these scenes; trees that grew
there; flowers; a certain light; a few figures. Everything tended
to set itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom. None
of this throwing of hands about; people spoke in an ordinary tone
of voice. They went in and out all day long. There was an old woman
gossiping in the kitchen; and the blinds were sucked in and out by
the breeze; all was blowing, all was growing; and over all those
plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very
thin yellow veil would be drawn, like a vine leaf, at night. Things
became stiller and darker at night. But the leaf-like veil was so
fine, that lights lifted it, voices crinkled it; he could see
through it a figure stooping, hear, coming close, going away, some
dress rustling, some chain tinkling.</p>
<p>It was in this world that the wheel went over the person's foot.
Something, he remembered, stayed flourished up in the air,
something arid and sharp descended even there, like a blade, a
scimitar, smiting through the leaves and flowers even of that happy
world and making it shrivel and fall.</p>
<p>“It will rain,” he remembered his father saying. "You won't be
able to go to the Lighthouse.”</p>
<p>The Lighthouse was then a silvery, misty-looking tower with a
yellow eye, that opened suddenly, and softly in the evening.
Now—</p>
<p>James looked at the Lighthouse. He could see the white-washed
rocks; the tower, stark and straight; he could see that it was
barred with black and white; he could see windows in it; he could
even see washing spread on the rocks to dry. So that was the
Lighthouse, was it?</p>
<p>No, the other was also the Lighthouse. For nothing was simply
one thing. The other Lighthouse was true too. It was sometimes
hardly to be seen across the bay. In the evening one looked up and
saw the eye opening and shutting and the light seemed to reach them
in that airy sunny garden where they sat.</p>
<p>But he pulled himself up. Whenever he said "they” or "a person,"
and then began hearing the rustle of some one coming, the tinkle of
some one going, he became extremely sensitive to the presence of
whoever might be in the room. It was his father now. The strain was
acute. For in one moment if there was no breeze, his father would
slap the covers of his book together, and say: "What's happening
now? What are we dawdling about here for, eh?” as, once before he
had brought his blade down among them on the terrace and she had
gone stiff all over, and if there had been an axe handy, a knife,
or anything with a sharp point he would have seized it and struck
his father through the heart. She had gone stiff all over, and
then, her arm slackening, so that he felt she listened to him no
longer, she had risen somehow and gone away and left him there,
impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping a pair of
scissors.</p>
<p>Not a breath of wind blew. The water chuckled and gurgled in the
bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up
and down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them. At any
moment Mr Ramsay (he scarcely dared look at him) might rouse
himself, shut his book, and say something sharp; but for the moment
he was reading, so that James stealthily, as if he were stealing
downstairs on bare feet, afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking
board, went on thinking what was she like, where did she go that
day? He began following her from room to room and at last they came
to a room where in a blue light, as if the reflection came from
many china dishes, she talked to somebody; he listened to her
talking. She talked to a servant, saying simply whatever came into
her head. She alone spoke the truth; to her alone could he speak
it. That was the source of her everlasting attraction for him,
perhaps; she was a person to whom one could say what came into
one's head. But all the time he thought of her, he was conscious of
his father following his thought, surveying it, making it shiver
and falter. At last he ceased to think.</p>
<p>There he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun, staring at
the Lighthouse, powerless to move, powerless to flick off these
grains of misery which settled on his mind one after another. A
rope seemed to bind him there, and his father had knotted it and he
could only escape by taking a knife and plunging it… But at that
moment the sail swung slowly round, filled slowly out, the boat
seemed to shake herself, and then to move off half conscious in her
sleep, and then she woke and shot through the waves. The relief was
extraordinary. They all seemed to fall away from each other again
and to be at their ease, and the fishing-lines slanted taut across
the side of the boat. But his father did not rouse himself. He only
raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air, and let it fall
upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret
symphony.</p>
