<p>So they're gone, she thought, sighing with relief and
disappointment. Her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her, like a
bramble sprung across her face. She felt curiously divided, as if
one part of her were drawn out there—it was a still day, hazy; the
Lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance; the other
had fixed itself doggedly, solidly, here on the lawn. She saw her
canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and
uncompromising directly before her. It seemed to rebuke her with
its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation; this folly and
waste of emotion; it drastically recalled her and spread through
her mind first a peace, as her disorderly sensations (he had gone
and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing) trooped
off the field; and then, emptiness. She looked blankly at the
canvas, with its uncompromising white stare; from the canvas to the
garden. There was something (she stood screwing up her little
Chinese eyes in her small puckered face), something she remembered
in the relations of those lines cutting across, slicing down, and
in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns,
which had stayed in her mind; which had tied a knot in her mind so
that at odds and ends of time, involuntarily, as she walked along
the Brompton Road, as she brushed her hair, she found herself
painting that picture, passing her eye over it, and untying the
knot in imagination. But there was all the difference in the world
between this planning airily away from the canvas and actually
taking her brush and making the first mark.</p>
<p>She had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at Mr Ramsay's
presence, and her easel, rammed into the earth so nervously, was at
the wrong angle. And now that she had ut that right, and in so
doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked
her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a
person, had such and such relations to people, she took her hand
and raised her brush. For a moment it stayed trembling in a painful
but exciting ecstasy in the air. Where to begin?—that was the
question at what point to make the first mark? One line placed on
the canvas committed her to innumerable risks, to frequent and
irrevocable decisions. All that in idea seemed simple became in
practice immediately complex; as the waves shape themselves
symmetrically from the cliff top, but to the swimmer among them are
divided by steep gulfs, and foaming crests. Still the risk must be
run; the mark made.</p>
<p>With a curious physical sensation, as if she were urged forward
and at the same time must hold herself back, she made her first
quick decisive stroke. The brush descended. It flickered brown over
the white canvas; it left a running mark. A second time she did
it—a third time. And so pausing and so flickering, she attained a
dancing rhythmical movement, as if the pauses were one part of the
rhythm and the strokes another, and all were related; and so,
lightly and swiftly pausing, striking, she scored her canvas with
brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than
they enclosed ( she felt it looming out at her) a space. Down in
the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and
higher above her. For what could be more formidable than that
space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at
it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with
people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of
hers—this other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly
laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances and
commanded her attention. She was half unwilling, half reluctant.
Why always be drawn out and haled away? Why not left in peace, to
talk to Mr Carmichael on the lawn? It was an exacting form of
intercourse anyhow. Other worshipful objects were content with
worship; men, women, God, all let one kneel prostrate; but this
form, were it only the shape of a white lamp-shade looming on a
wicker table, roused one to perpetual combat, challenged one to a
fight in which one was bound to be worsted. Always (it was in her
nature, or in her sex, she did not know which) before she exchanged
the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a
few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a
soul reft of body, hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed
without protection to all the blasts of doubt. Why then did she do
it? She looked at the canvas, lightly scored with running lines. It
would be hung in the servants' bedrooms. It would be rolled up and
stuffed under a sofa. What was the good of doing it then, and she
heard some voice saying she couldn't paint, saying she couldn't
create, as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents
in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind, so that
one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally
spoke them.</p>
<p>Can't paint, can't write, she murmured monotonously, anxiously
considering what her plan of attack should be. For the mass loomed
before her; it protruded; she felt it pressing on her eyeballs.
Then, as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her
faculties were spontaneously squirted, she began precariously
dipping among the blues and umbers, moving her brush hither and
thither, but it was now heavier and went slower, as if it had
fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her (she kept
looking at the hedge, at the canvas) by what she rhythm was strong
enough to bear her along with it on its current. Certainly she was
losing consciousness of outer things. And as she lost consciousness
of outer things, and her name and her personality and her
appearance, and whether Mr Carmichael was there or not, her mind
kept throwing up from its depths, scenes, and names, and sayings,
and memories and ideas, like a fountain spurting over that glaring,
hideously difficult white space, while she modelled it with greens
and blues.</p>
<p>Charles Tansley used to say that, she remembered, women can't
paint, can't write. Coming up behind her, he had stood close beside
her, a thing she hated, as she painted her on this very spot. "Shag
tobacco,” he said, "fivepence an ounce,” parading his poverty, his
principles. (But the war had drawn the sting of her femininity.
Poor devils, one thought, poor devils, of both sexes.) He was
always carrying a book about under his arm—a purple book. He
"worked.” He sat, she remembered, working in a blaze of sun. At
dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view. But after all,
she reflected, there was the scene on the beach. One must remember
that. It was a windy morning. They had all gone down to the beach.
Mrs Ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock. She wrote and
wrote. "Oh,” she said, looking up at something floating in the sea,
"is it a lobster pot? Is it an upturned boat?” She was so
short-sighted that she could not see, and then Charles Tansley
became as nice as he could possibly be. He began playing ducks and
drakes. They chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping
over the waves. Every now and then Mrs Ramsay looked up over her
spectacles and laughed at them. What they said she could not
remember, but only she and Charles throwing stones and getting on
very well all of a sudden and Mrs Ramsay watching them. She was
highly conscious of that. Mrs Ramsay, she thought, stepping back
and screwing up her eyes. (It must have altered the design a good
deal when she was sitting on the step with James. There must have
been a shadow.) When she thought of herself and Charles throwing
ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach, it seemed to
depend somehow upon Mrs Ramsay sitting under the rock, with a pad
on her knee, writing letters. (She wrote innumerable letters, and
sometimes the wind took them and she and Charles just saved a page
from the sea.) But what a power was in the human soul! she thought.
That woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything
into simplicity; made these angers, irritations fall off like old
rags; she brought together this and that and then this, and so made
out of that miserable silliness and spite (she and Charles
squabbling, sparring, had been silly and spiteful) something—this
scene on the beach for example, this moment of friendship and
liking—which survived, after all these years complete, so that she
dipped into it to re-fashion her memory of him, and there it stayed
in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art.</p>
<p>“Like a work of art,” she repeated, looking from her canvas to
the drawing-room steps and back again. She must rest for a moment.
And, resting, looking from one to the other vaguely, the old
question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually, the vast,
the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such
moments as these, when she released faculties that had been on the
strain, stood over her, paused over her, darkened over her. What is
the meaning of life? That was all—a simple question; one that
tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had
never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead
there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck
unexpectedly in the dark; here was one. This, that, and the other;
herself and Charles Tansley and the breaking wave; Mrs Ramsay
bringing them together; Mrs Ramsay saying, "Life stand still here";
Mrs Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another
sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something
permanent)—this was of the nature of a revelation. In the midst of
chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing (she looked
at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into
stability. Life stand still here, Mrs Ramsay said. "Mrs Ramsay! Mrs
Ramsay!” she repeated. She owed it all to her.</p>
<p>All was silence. Nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house.
She looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its
windows green and blue with the reflected leaves. The faint thought
she was thinking of Mrs Ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet
house; this smoke; this fine early morning air. Faint and unreal,
it was amazingly pure and exciting. She hoped nobody would open the
window or come out of the house, but that she might be left alone
to go on thinking, to go on painting. She turned to her canvas. But
impelled by some curiosity, driven by the discomfort of the
sympathy which she held undischarged, she walked a pace or so to
the end of the lawn to see whether, down there on the beach, she
could see that little company setting sail. Down there among the
little boats which floated, some with their sails furled, some
slowly, for it was very calm moving away, there was one rather
apart from the others. The sail was even now being hoisted. She
decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little
boat Mr Ramsay was sitting with Cam and James. Now they had got the
sail up; now after a little flagging and silence, she watched the
boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to
sea.</p>
