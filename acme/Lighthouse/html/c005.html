<p>“And even if it isn't fine tomorrow,” said Mrs Ramsay, raising
her eyes to glance at William Bankes and Lily Briscoe as they
passed, "it will be another day. And now,” she said, thinking that
Lily's charm was her Chinese eyes, aslant in her white, puckered
little face, but it would take a clever man to see it, "and now
stand up, and let me measure your leg,” for they might go to the
Lighthouse after all, and she must see if the stocking did not need
to be an inch or two longer in the leg.</p>
<p>Smiling, for it was an admirable idea, that had flashed upon her
this very second—William and Lily should marry—she took the
heather-mixture stocking, with its criss-cross of steel needles at
the mouth of it, and measured it against James's leg.</p>
<p>“My dear, stand still,” she said, for in his jealousy, not
liking to serve as measuring block for the Lighthouse keeper's
little boy, James fidgeted purposely; and if he did that, how could
she see, was it too long, was it too short? she asked.</p>
<p>She looked up—what demon possessed him, her youngest, her
cherished?—and saw the room, saw the chairs, thought them fearfully
shabby. Their entrails, as Andrew said the other day, were all over
the floor; but then what was the point, she asked, of buying good
chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the
house, with only one old woman to see to it, positively dripped
with wet? Never mind, the rent was precisely twopence half-penny;
the children loved it; it did her husband good to be three
thousand, or if she must be accurate, three hundred miles from his
libraries and his lectures and his disciples; and there was room
for visitors. Mats, camp beds, crazy ghosts of chairs and tables
whose London life of service was done—they did well enough here;
and a photograph or two, and books. Books, she thought, grew of
themselves. She never had time to read them. Alas! even the books
that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet
himself: "For her whose wishes must be obeyed"… "The happier Helen
of our days"… disgraceful to say, she had never read them. And
Croom on the Mind and Bates on the Savage Customs of Polynesia ("My
dear, stand still,” she said)—neither of those could one send to
the Lighthouse. At a certain moment, she supposed, the house would
become so shabby that something must be done. If they could be
taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them—that
would be something. Crabs, she had to allow, if Andrew really
wished to dissect them, or if Jasper believed that one could make
soup from seaweed, one could not prevent it; or Rose's
objects—shells, reeds, stones; for they were gifted, her children,
but all in quite different ways. And the result of it was, she
sighed, taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling, as she held
the stocking against James's leg, that things got shabbier and got
shabbier summer after summer. The mat was fading; the wall-paper
was flapping. You couldn't tell any more that those were roses on
it. Still, if every door in a house is left perpetually open, and
no lockmaker in the whole of Scotland can mend a bolt, things must
spoil. What was the use of flinging a green Cashemere shawl over
the edge of a picture frame? In two weeks it would be the colour of
pea soup. But it was the doors that annoyed her; every door was
left open. She listened. The drawing-room door was open; the hall
door was open; it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open; and
certainly the window on the landing was open, for that she had
opened herself. That windows should be open, and doors shut—simple
as it was, could none of them remember it? She would go into the
maids' bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens, except
for Marie's, the Swiss girl, who would rather go without a bath
than without fresh air, but then at home, she had said, "the
mountains are so beautiful.” She had said that last night looking
out of the window with tears in her eyes. "The mountains are so
beautiful.” Her father was dying there, Mrs Ramsay knew. He was
leaving them fatherless. Scolding and demonstrating (how to make a
bed, how to open a window, with hands that shut and spread like a
Frenchwoman's) all had folded itself quietly about her, when the
girl spoke, as, after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a
bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes
from bright steel to soft purple. She had stood there silent for
there was nothing to be said. He had cancer of the throat. At the
recolection—how she had stood there, how the girl had said, "At
home the mountains are so beautiful,” and there was no hope, no
hope whatever, she had a spasm of irritation, and speaking sharply,
said to James:</p>
<p>“Stand still. Don't be tiresome,” so that he knew instantly that
her severity was real, and straightened his leg and she measured
it.</p>
<p>The stocking was too short by half an inch at least, making
allowance for the fact that Sorley's little boy would be less well
grown than James.</p>
<p>“It's too short,” she said, "ever so much too short.”</p>
<p>Never did anybody look so sad. Bitter and black, half-way down,
in the darkness, in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the
depths, perhaps a tear formed; a tear fell; the waters swayed this
way and that, received it, and were at rest. Never did anybody look
so sad.</p>
<p>But was it nothing but looks, people said? What was there behind
it—her beauty and splendour? Had he blown his brains out, they
asked, had he died the week before they were married—some other,
earlier lover, of whom rumours reached one? Or was there nothing?
nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind, and
could do nothing to disturb? For easily though she might have said
at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion, of love
foiled, of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or
felt or been through it herself, she never spoke. She was silent
always. She knew then—she knew without having learnt. Her
simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified. Her singleness of
mind made her drop plumb like a stone, alight exact as a bird, gave
her, naturally, this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which
delighted, eased, sustained—falsely perhaps.</p>
<p>("Nature has but little clay,” said Mr Bankes once, much moved
by her voice on the telephone, though she was only telling him a
fact about a train, "like that of which she moulded you.” He saw
her at the end of the line, Greek, blue-eyed, straight-nosed. How
incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that. The
Graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of
asphodel to compose that face. Yes, he would catch the 10:30 at
Euston.</p>
<p>“But she's no more aware of her beauty than a child,” said Mr
Bankes, replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what
progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were
building at the back of his house. And he thought of Mrs Ramsay as
he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls. For always, he
thought, there was something incongruous to be worked into the
harmony of her face. She clapped a deer-stalker's hat on her head;
she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from
mischief. So that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of,
one must remember the quivering thing, the living thing (they were
carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them), and work it
into the picture; or if one thought of her simply as a woman, one
must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy—she did not like
admiration—or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of
form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty, and
she wanted only to be like other people, insignificant. He did not
know. He did not know. He must go to his work.)</p>
<p>Knitting her reddish-brown hairy stocking, with her head
outlined absurdly by the gilt frame, the green shawl which she had
tossed over the edge of the frame, and the authenticated
masterpiece by Michael Angelo, Mrs Ramsay smoothed out what had
been harsh in her manner a moment before, raised his head, and
kissed her little boy on the forehead. "Let us find another picture
to cut out,” she said.</p>
