<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<p>But his son hated him. He hated him for coming up to them, for
stopping and looking down on them; he hated him for interrupting
them; he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his
gestures; for the magnificence of his head; for his exactingness
and egotism (for there he stood, commanding them to attend to him)
but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father's
emotion which, vibrating round them, disturbed the perfect
simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother. By
looking fixedly at the page, he hoped to make him move on; by
pointing his finger at a word, he hoped to recall his mother's
attention, which, he knew angrily, wavered instantly his father
stopped. But, no. Nothing would make Mr Ramsay move on. There he
stood, demanding sympathy.</p>
<p>Mrs Ramsay, who had been sitting loosely, folding her son in her
arm, braced herself, and, half turning, seemed to raise herself
with an effort, and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of
energy, a column of spray, looking at the same time animated and
alive as if all her energies were being fused into force, burning
and illuminating (quietly though she sat, taking up her stocking
again), and into this delicious fecundity, this fountain and spray
of life, the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself, like a
beak of brass, barren and bare. He wanted sympathy. He was a
failure, he said. Mrs Ramsay flashed her needles. Mr Ramsay
repeated, never taking his eyes from her face, that he was a
failure. She blew the words back at him. "Charles Tansley… ” she
said. But he must have more than that. It was sympathy he wanted,
to be assured of his genius, first of all, and then to be taken
within the circle of life, warmed and soothed, to have his senses
restored to him, his barrenness made furtile, and all the rooms of
the house made full of life—the drawing-room; behind the
drawing-room the kitchen; above the kitchen the bedrooms; and
beyond them the nurseries; they must be furnished, they must be
filled with life.</p>
<p>Charles Tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the
time, she said. But he must have more than that. He must have
sympathy. He must be assured that he too lived in the heart of
life; was needed; not only here, but all over the world. Flashing
her needles, confident, upright, she created drawing-room and
kitchen, set them all aglow; bade him take his ease there, go in
and out, enjoy himself. She laughed, she knitted. Standing between
her knees, very stiff, James felt all her strength flaring up to be
drunk and quenched by the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of the
male, which smote mercilessly, again and again, demanding
sympathy.</p>
<p>He was a failure, he repeated. Well, look then, feel then.
Flashing her needles, glancing round about her, out of the window,
into the room, at James himself, she assured him, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, by her laugh, her poise, her competence (as a nurse
carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child),
that it was real; the house was full; the garden blowing. If he put
implicit faith in her, nothing should hurt him; however deep he
buried himself or climed high, not for a second should he find
himself without her. So boasting of her capacity to surround and
protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know
herself by; all was so lavished and spent; and James, as he stood
stiff between her knees, felt her rise in a rosy-flowered fruit
tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of
brass, the arid scimitar of his father, the egotistical man,
plunged and smote, demanding sympathy.</p>
<p>Filled with her words, like a child who drops off satisfied, he
said, at last, looking at her with humble gratitude, restored,
renewed, that he would take a turn; he would watch the children
playing cricket. He went.</p>
<p>Immediately, Mrs Ramsey seemed to fold herself together, one
petal closed in another, and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion
upon itself, so that she had only strength enough to move her
finger, in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion, across the page of
Grimm's fairy story, while there throbbed through her, like a pulse
in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently
ceases to beat, the rapture of successful creation.</p>
<p>Every throb of this pulse seemed, as he walked away, to enclose
her and her husband, and to give to each that solace which two
different notes, one high, one low, struck together, seem to give
each other as they combine. Yet as the resonance died, and she
turned to the Fairy Tale again, Mrs Ramsey felt not only exhausted
in body (afterwards, not at the time, she always felt this) but
also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable
sensation with another origin. Not that, as she read aloud the
story of the Fisherman's Wife, she knew precisely what it came
from; nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction
when she realized, at the turn of the page when she stopped and
heard dully, ominously, a wave fall, how it came from this: she did
not like, even for a second, to feel finer than her husband; and
further, could not bear not being entirely sure, when she spoke to
him, of the truth of what she said. Universities and people wanting
him, lectures and books and their being of the highest
importance—all that she did not doubt for a moment; but it was
their relation, and his coming to her like that, openly, so that
any one could see, that discomposed her; for then people said he
depended on her, when they must know that of the two he was
infinitely the more important, and what she gave the world, in
comparison with what he gave, negligable. But then again, it was
the other thing too—not being able to tell him the truth, being
afraid, for instance, about the greenhouse roof and the expense it
would be, fifty pounds perhaps to mend it; and then about his
books, to be afraid that he might guess, what she a little
suspected, that his last book was not quite his best book (she
gathered that from William Bankes); and then to hide small daily
things, and the children seeing it, and the burden it laid on
them—all this diminished the entire joy, the pure joy, of the two
notes sounding together, and let the sound die on her ear now with
a dismal flatness.</p>
<p>A shadow was on the page; she looked up. It was Augustus
Carmichael shuffling past, precisely now, at the very moment when
it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human
relationships, that the most perfect was flawed, and could not bear
the examination which, loving her husband, with her instinct for
truth, she turned upon it; when it was painful to feel herself
convicted of unworthiness, and impeded in her proper function by
these lies, these exaggerations,—it was at this moment when she was
fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation, that Mr
Carmichael shuffled past, in his yellow slippers, and some demon in
her made it necessary for her to call out, as he passed,</p>
<p>“Going indoors Mr Carmichael?”</p>
