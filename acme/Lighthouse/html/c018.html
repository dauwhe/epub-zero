<p>As usual, Lily thought. There was always something that had to
be done at that precise moment, something that Mrs Ramsay had
decided for reasons of her own to do instantly, it might be with
every one standing about making jokes, as now, not being able to
decide whether they were going into the smoking-room, into the
drawing-room, up to the attics. Then one saw Mrs Ramsay in the
midst of this hubbub standing there with Minta's arm in hers,
bethink her, "Yes, it is time for that now,” and so make off at
once with an air of secrecy to do something alone. And directly she
went a sort of disintegration set in; they wavered about, went
different ways, Mr Bankes took Charles Tansley by the arm and went
off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at
dinner about politics, thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the
evening, making the weight fall in a different direction, as if,
Lily thought, seeing them go, and hearing a word or two about the
policy of the Labour Party, they had gone up on to the bridge of
the ship and were taking their bearings; the change from poetry to
politics struck her like that; so Mr Bankes and Charles Mrs Ramsay
going upstairs in the lamplight alone. Where, Lily wondered, was
she going so quickly?</p>
<p>Not that she did in fact run or hurry; she went indeed rather
slowly. She felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still
after all that chatter, and pick out one particular thing; the
thing that mattered; to detach it; separate it off; clean it of all
the emotions and odds and ends of things, and so hold it before
her, and bring it to the tribunal where, ranged about in conclave,
sat the judges she had set up to decide these things. Is it good,
is it bad, is it right or wrong? Where are we all going to? and so
on. So she righted herself after the shock of the event, and quite
unconsciously and incongruously, used the branches of the elm trees
outside to help her to stabilise her position. Her world was
changing: they were still. The event had given her a sense of
movement. All must be in order. She must get that right and that
right, she thought, insensibly approving of the dignity of the
trees' stillness, and now again of the superb upward rise (like the
beak of a ship up a wave) of the elm branches as the wind raised
them. For it was windy (she stood a moment to look out). It was
windy, so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star, and the
stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying
to flash out between the edges of the leaves. Yes, that was done
then, accomplished; and as with all things done, became solemn. Now
one thought of it, cleared of chatter and emotion, it seemed always
to have been, only was shown now and so being shown, struck
everything into stability. They would, she thought, going on again,
however long they lived, come back to this night; this moon; this
wind; this house: and to her too. It flattered her, where she was
most susceptible of flattery, to think how, wound about in their
hearts, however long they lived she would be woven; and this, and
this, and this, she thought, going upstairs, laughing, but
affectionately, at the sofa on the landing (her mother's); at the
rocking-chair (her father's); at the map of the Hebrides. All that
would be revived again in the lives of Paul and Minta; "the
Rayleys"—she tried the new name over; and she felt, with her hand
on the nursery door, that community of feeling with other people
which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin
that practically (the feeling was one of relief and happiness) it
was all one stream, and chairs, tables, maps, were hers, were
theirs, it did not matter whose, and Paul and Minta would carry it
on when she was dead.</p>
<p>She turned the handle, firmly, lest it should squeak, and went
in, pursing her lips slightly, as if to remind herself that she
must not speak aloud. But directly she came in she saw, with
annoyance, that the precaution was not needed. The children were
not asleep. It was most annoying. Mildred should be more careful.
There was James wide awake and Cam sitting bolt upright, and
Mildred out of bed in her bare feet, and it was almost eleven and
they were all talking. What was the matter? It was that horrid
skull again. She had told Mildred to move it, but Mildred, of
course, had forgotten, and now there was Cam wide awake, and James
wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours
ago. What had possessed Edward to send them this horrid skull? She
had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there. It was nailed
fast, Mildred said, and Cam couldn't go to sleep with it in the
room, and James screamed if she touched it.</p>
<p>Then Cam must go to sleep (it had great horns said Cam)—must go
to sleep and dream of lovely palaces, said Mrs Ramsay, sitting down
on the bed by her side. She could see the horns, Cam said, all over
the room. It was true. Wherever they put the light (and James could
not sleep without a light) there was always a shadow somewhere.</p>
<p>“But think, Cam, it's only an old pig,” said Mrs Ramsay, "a nice
black pig like the pigs at the farm.” But Cam thought it was a
horrid thing, branching at her all over the room.</p>
<p>“Well then,” said Mrs Ramsay, "we will cover it up,” and they
all watched her go to the chest of drawers, and open the little
drawers quickly one after another, and not seeing anything that
would do, she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the
skull, round and round and round, and then she came back to Cam and
laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside Cam's and said how
lovely it looked now; how the fairies would love it; it was like a
bird's nest; it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen
abroad, with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds
singing and little goats and antelopes and… She could see the words
echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in Cam's mind, and Cam was
repeating after her how it was like a mountain, a bird's nest, a
garden, and there were little antelopes, and her eyes were opening
and shutting, and Mrs Ramsay went on speaking still more
monotonously, and more rhythmically and more nonsensically, how she
must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and
valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens,
and everything lovely, she said, raising her head very slowly and
speaking more and more mechanically, until she sat upright and saw
that Cam was asleep.</p>
<p>Now, she whispered, crossing over to his bed, James must go to
sleep too, for see, she said, the boar's skull was still there;
they had not touched it; they had done just what he wanted; it was
there quite unhurt. He made sure that the skull was still there
under the shawl. But he wanted to ask her something more. Would
they go to the Lighthouse tomorrow?</p>
<p>No, not tomorrow, she said, but soon, she promised him; the next
fine day. He was very good. He lay down. She covered him up. But he
would never forget, she knew, and she felt angry with Charles
Tansley, with her husband, and with herself, for she had raised his
hopes. Then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had
wrapped it round the boar's skull, she got up, and pulled the
window down another inch or two, and heard the wind, and got a
breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured
good night to Mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the
door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out.</p>
<p>She hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their
heads, she thought, still thinking how annoying Charles Tansley
was. For neither of them slept well; they were excitable children,
and since he said things like that about the Lighthouse, it seemed
to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over, just as
they were going to sleep, clumsily sweeping them off the table with
his elbow. For she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work. Yet
he looked so desolate; yet she would feel relieved when he went;
yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow; yet he was
admirable with her husband; yet his manners certainly wanted
improving; yet she liked his laugh—thinking this, as she came
downstairs, she noticed that she could now see the moon itself
through the staircase window—the yellow harvest moon— and turned,
and they saw her, standing above them on the stairs.</p>
<p>“That's my mother,” thought Prue. Yes; Minta should look at her;
Paul Rayley should look at her. That is the thing itself, she felt,
as if there were only one person like that in the world; her
mother. And, from having been quite grown up, a moment before,
talking with the others, she became a child again, and what they
had been doing was a game, and would her mother sanction their
game, or condemn it, she wondered. And thinking what a chance it
was for Minta and Paul and Lily to see her, and feeling what an
extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her, to have her, and
how she would never grow up and never leave home, she said, like a
child, "We thought of going down to the beach to watch the
waves.”</p>
<p>Instantly, for no reason at all, Mrs Ramsay became like a girl
of twenty, full of gaiety. A mood of revelry suddenly took
possession of her. Of course they must go; of course they must go,
she cried, laughing; and running down the last three or four steps
quickly, she began turning from one to the other and laughing and
drawing Minta's wrap round her and saying she only wished she could
come too, and would they be very late, and had any of them got a
watch?</p>
<p>“Yes, Paul has,” said Minta. Paul slipped a beautiful gold watch
out of a little wash-leather case to show her. And as he held it in
the palm of his hand before her, he felt, "She knows all about it.
I need not say anything.” He was saying to her as he showed her the
watch, "I've done it, Mrs Ramsay. I owe it all to you.” And seeing
the gold watch lying in his hand, Mrs Ramsay felt, How
extraordinarily lucky Minta is! She is marrying a man who has a
gold watch in a wash- leather bag!</p>
<p>“How I wish I could come with you!” she cried. But she was
withheld by something so strong that she never even thought of
asking herself what it was. Of course it was impossible for her to
go with them. But she would have liked to go, had it not been for
the other thing, and tickled by the absurdity of her thought (how
lucky to marry a man with a wash-leather bag for his watch) she
went with a smile on her lips into the other room, where her
husband sat reading.</p>
