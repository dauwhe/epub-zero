<p>She folded the green shawl about her shoulders. She took his
arm. His beauty was so great, she said, beginning to speak of
Kennedy the gardener, at once he was so awfully handsome, that she
couldn't dismiss him. There was a ladder against the greenhouse,
and little lumps of putty stuck about, for they were beginning to
mend the greenhouse. Yes, but as she strolled along with her
husband, she felt that that particular source of worry had been
placed. She had it on the tip of her tongue to say, as they
strolled, "It'll cost fifty pounds,” but instead, for her heart
failed her about money, she talked about Jasper shooting birds, and
he said, at once, soothing her instantly, that it was natural in a
boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself
before long. Her husband was so sensible, so just. And so she said,
"Yes; all children go through stages,” and began considering the
dahlias in the big bed, and wondering what about next year's
flowers, and had he heard the children's nickname for Charles
Tansley, she asked. The atheist, they called him, the little
atheist. "He's not a polished specimen,” said Mr Ramsay. "Far from
it,” said Mrs Ramsay.</p>
<p>She supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices,
Mrs Ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down
bulbs; did they plant them? "Oh, he has his dissertation to write,"
said Mr Ramsay. She knew all about THAT, said Mrs Ramsay. He talked
of nothing else. It was about the influence of somebody upon
something. "Well, it's all he has to count on,” said Mr Ramsay.
"Pray Heaven he won't fall in love with Prue,” said Mrs Ramsay.
He'd disinherit her if she married him, said Mr Ramsay. He did not
look at the flowers, which his wife was considering, but at a spot
about a foot or so above them. There was no harm in him, he added,
and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in
England who admired his—when he choked it back. He would not bother
her again about his books. These flowers seemed creditable, Mr
Ramsay said, lowering his gaze and noticing something red,
something brown. Yes, but then these she had put in with her own
hands, said Mrs Ramsay. The question was, what happened if she sent
bulbs down; did Kennedy plant them? It was his incurable laziness;
she added, moving on. If she stood over him all day long with a
spade in her hand, he did sometimes do a stroke of work. So they
strolled along, towards the red-hot pokers. "You're teaching your
daughters to exaggerate,” said Mr Ramsay, reproving her. Her Aunt
Camilla was far worse than she was, Mrs Ramsay remarked. "Nobody
ever held up your Aunt Camilla as a model of virtue that I'm aware
of,” said Mr Ramsay. "She was the most beautiful woman I ever saw,"
said Mrs Ramsay. "Somebody else was that,” said Mr Ramsay. Prue was
going to be far more beautiful than she was, said Mrs Ramsay. He
saw no trace of it, said Mr Ramsay. "Well, then, look tonight,"
said Mrs Ramsay. They paused. He wished Andrew could be induced to
work harder. He would lose every chance of a scholarship if he
didn't. "Oh, scholarships!” she said. Mr Ramsay thought her foolish
for saying that, about a serious thing, like a scholarship. He
should be very proud of Andrew if he got a scholarship, he said.
She would be just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered. They
disagreed always about this, but it did not matter. She liked him
to believe in scholarships, and he liked her to be proud of Andrew
whatever he did. Suddenly she remembered those little paths on the
edge of the cliffs.</p>
<p>Wasn't it late? she asked. They hadn't come home yet. He flicked
his watch carelessly open. But it was only just past seven. He held
his watch open for a moment, deciding that he would tell her what
he had felt on the terrace. To begin with, it was not reasonable to
be so nervous. Andrew could look after himself. Then, he wanted to
tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now—here he
became uncomfortable, as if he were breaking into that solitude,
that aloofness, that remoteness of hers. But she pressed him. What
had he wanted to tell her, she asked, thinking it was about going
to the Lighthouse; that he was sorry he had said "Damn you.” But
no. He did not like to see her look so sad, he said. Only wool
gathering, she protested, flushing a little. They both felt
uncomfortable, as if they did not know whether to go on or go back.
She had been reading fairy tales to James, she said. No, they could
not share that; they could not say that.</p>
<p>They had reached the gap between the two clumps of red-hot
pokers, and there was the Lighthouse again, but she would not let
herself look at it. Had she known that he was looking at her, she
thought, she would not have let herself sit there, thinking. She
disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting
thinking. So she looked over her shoulder, at the town. The lights
were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water
held firm in a wind. And all the poverty, all the suffering had
turned to that, Mrs Ramsay thought. The lights of the town and of
the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating
there to mark something which had sunk. Well, if he could not share
her thoughts, Mr Ramsay said to himself, he would be off, then, on
his own. He wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the story how
Hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh. But first it was
nonsense to be anxious about Andrew. When he was Andrew's age he
used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a
biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him, or thought
that he had fallen over a cliff. He said aloud he thought he would
be off for a day's walk if the weather held. He had had about
enough of Bankes and of Carmichael. He would like a little
solitude. Yes, she said. It annoyed him that she did not protest.
She knew that he would never do it. He was too old now to walk all
day long with a biscuit in his pocket. She worried about the boys,
but not about him. Years ago, before he had married, he thought,
looking across the bay, as they stood between the clumps of red-hot
pokers, he had walked all day. He had made a meal off bread and
cheese in a public house. He had worked ten hours at a stretch; an
old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the
fire. That was the country he liked best, over there; those
sandhills dwindling away into darkness. One could walk all day
without meeting a soul. There was not a house scarcely, not a
single village for miles on end. One could worry things out alone.
There were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the
beginning of time. The seals sat up and looked at you. It sometimes
seemed to him that in a little house out there, alone—he broke off,
sighing. He had no right. The father of eight children—he reminded
himself. And he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single
thing altered. Andrew would be a better man than he had been. Prue
would be a beauty, her mother said. They would stem the flood a
bit. That was a good bit of work on the whole—his eight children.
They showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely, for
on an evening like this, he thought, looking at the land dwindling
away, the little island seemed pathetically small, half swallowed
up in the sea.</p>
<p>“Poor little place,” he murmured with a sigh.</p>
<p>She heard him. He said the most melancholy things, but she
noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more
cheerful than usual. All this phrase-making was a game, she
thought, for if she had said half what he said, she would have
blown her brains out by now.</p>
<p>It annoyed her, this phrase-making, and she said to him, in a
matter- of-fact way, that it was a perfectly lovely evening. And
what was he groaning about, she asked, half laughing, half
complaining, for she guessed what he was thinking—he would have
written better books if he had not married.</p>
<p>He was not complaining, he said. She knew that he did not
complain. She knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of. And
he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an
intensity that brought the tears to her eyes, and quickly he
dropped it.</p>
<p>They turned away from the view and began to walk up the path
where the silver-green spear-like plants grew, arm in arm. His arm
was almost like a young man's arm, Mrs Ramsay thought, thin and
hard, and she thought with delight how strong he still was, though
he was over sixty, and how untamed and optimistic, and how strange
it was that being convinced, as he was, of all sorts of horrors,
seemed not to depress him, but to cheer him. Was it not odd, she
reflected? Indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from
other people, born blind, deaf, and dumb, to the ordinary things,
but to the extraordinary things, with an eye like an eagle's. His
understanding often astonished her. But did he notice the flowers?
No. Did he notice the view? No. Did he even notice his own
daughter's beauty, or whether there was pudding on his plate or
roast beef? He would sit at table with them like a person in a
dream. And his habit of talking aloud, or saying poetry aloud, was
growing on him, she was afraid; for sometimes it was awkward—</p>
<p>Best and brightest come away!</p>
<p>poor Miss Giddings, when he shouted that at her, almost jumped
out of her skin. But then, Mrs Ramsay, though instantly taking his
side against all the silly Giddingses in the world, then, she
thought, intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked
up hill too fast for her, and she must stop for a moment to see
whether those were fresh molehills on the bank, then, she thought,
stooping down to look, a great mind like his must be different in
every way from ours. All the great men she had ever known, she
thought, deciding that a rabbit must have got in, were like that,
and it was good for young men (though the atmosphere of
lecture-rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance
almost) simply to hear him, simply to look at him. But without
shooting rabbits, how was one to keep them down? she wondered. It
might be a rabbit; it might be a mole. Some creature anyhow was
ruining her Evening Primroses. And looking up, she saw above the
thin trees the first pulse of the full-throbbing star, and wanted
to make her husband look at it; for the sight gave her such keen
pleasure. But she stopped herself. He never looked at things. If he
did, all he would say would be, Poor little world, with one of his
sighs.</p>
<p>At that moment, he said, "Very fine,” to please her, and
pretended to admire the flowers. But she knew quite well that he
did not admire them, or even realise that they were there. It was
only to please her. Ah, but was that not Lily Briscoe strolling
along with William Bankes? She focussed her short-sighted eyes upon
the backs of a retreating couple. Yes, indeed it was. Did that not
mean that they would marry? Yes, it must! What an admirable idea!
They must marry!</p>
