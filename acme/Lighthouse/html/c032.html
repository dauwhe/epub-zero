<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>Suddenly Mr Ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked
straight at her, with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so
penetrating, as if he saw you, for one second, for the first time,
for ever; and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so
as to escape him—to escape his demand on her, to put aside a moment
longer that imperious need. And he shook his head at her, and
strode on ("Alone” she heard him say, "Perished” she heard him say)
and like everything else this strange morning the words became
symbols, wrote themselves all over the grey-green walls. If only
she could put them together, she felt, write them out in some
sentence, then she would have got at the truth of things. Old Mr
Carmichael came padding softly in, fetched his coffee, took his cup
and made off to sit in the sun. The extraordinary unreality was
frightening; but it was also exciting. Going to the Lighthouse. But
what does one send to the Lighthouse? Perished. Alone. The
grey-green light on the wall opposite. The empty places. Such were
some of the parts, but how bring them together? she asked. As if
any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on
the table she turned her back to the window lest Mr Ramsay should
see her. She must escape somewhere, be alone somewhere. Suddenly
she remembered. When she had sat there last ten years ago there had
been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table-cloth, which she
had looked at in a moment of revelation. There had been a problem
about a foreground of a picture. Move the tree to the middle, she
had said. She had never finished that picture. She would paint that
picture now. It had been knocking about in her mind all these
years. Where were her paints, she wondered? Her paints, yes. She
had left them in the hall last night. She would start at once. She
got up quickly, before Mr Ramsay turned.</p>
<p>She fetched herself a chair. She pitched her easel with her
precise old-maidish movements on the edge of the lawn, not too
close to Mr Carmichael, but close enough for his protection. Yes,
it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago.
There was the wall; the hedge; the tree. The question was of some
relation between those masses. She had borne it in her mind all
these years. It seemed as if the solution had come to her: she knew
now what she wanted to do.</p>
<p>But with Mr Ramsay bearing down on her, she could do nothing.
Every time he approached—he was walking up and down the
terrace—ruin approached, chaos approached. She could not paint. She
stooped, she turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube.
But all she did was to ward him off a moment. He made it impossible
for her to do anything. For if she gave him the least chance, if he
saw her disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be
on her, saying, as he had said last night, "You find us much
changed.” Last night he had got up and stopped before her, and said
that. Dumb and staring though they had all sat, the six children
whom they used to call after the Kings and Queens of England—the
Red, the Fair, the Wicked, the Ruthless—she felt how they raged
under it. Kind old Mrs Beckwith said something sensible. But it was
a house full of unrelated passions—she had felt that all the
evening. And on top of this chaos Mr Ramsay got up, pressed her
hand, and said: "You will find us much changed” and none of them
had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as if they were forced
to let him say it. Only James (certainly the Sullen) scowled at the
lamp; and Cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger. Then he
reminded them that they were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow. They
must be ready, in the hall, on the stroke of half-past seven. Then,
with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon them. Did
they not want to go? he demanded. Had they dared say No (he had
some reason for wanting it) he would have flung himself tragically
backwards into the bitter waters of depair. Such a gift he had for
gesture. He looked like a king in exile. Doggedly James said yes.
Cam stumbled more wretchedly. Yes, oh, yes, they'd both be ready,
they said. And it struck her, this was tragedy—not palls, dust, and
the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits subdued. James was
sixteen, Cam, seventeen, perhaps. She had looked round for some one
who was not there, for Mrs Ramsay, presumably. But there was only
kind Mrs Beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp. Then,
being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the sea, the
taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her,
the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone
under. It was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they
went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they
passed the staircase window. She had slept at once.</p>
<p>She set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel, as a barrier,
frail, but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off Mr Ramsay
and his exactingness. She did her best to look, when his back was
turned, at her picture; that line there, that mass there. But it
was out of the question. Let him be fifty feet away, let him not
even speak to you, let him not even see you, he permeated, he
prevailed, he imposed himself. He changed everything. She could not
see the colour; she could not see the lines; even with his back
turned to her, she could only think, But he'll be down on me in a
moment, demanding—something she felt she could not give him. She
rejected one brush; she chose another. When would those children
come? When would they all be off? she fidgeted. That man, she
thought, her anger rising in her, never gave; that man took. She,
on the other hand, would be forced to give. Mrs Ramsay had given.
Giving, giving, giving, she had died—and had left all this. Really,
she was angry with Mrs Ramsay. With the brush slightly trembling in
her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step, the wall. It was all
Mrs Ramsay's doing. She was dead. Here was Lily, at forty-four,
wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there, playing at
painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at, and it was
all Mrs Ramsay's fault. She was dead. The step where she used to
sit was empty. She was dead.</p>
<p>But why repeat this over and over again? Why be always trying to
bring up some feeling she had not got? There was a kind of
blasphemy in it. It was all dry: all withered: all spent. They
ought not to have asked her; she ought not to have come. One can't
waste one's time at forty- four, she thought. She hated playing at
painting. A brush, the one dependable thing in a world of strife,
ruin, chaos—that one should not play with, knowingly even: she
detested it. But he made her. You shan't touch your canvas, he
seemed to say, bearing down on her, till you've given me what I
want of you. Here he was, close upon her again, greedy, distraught.
Well, thought Lily in despair, letting her right hand fall at her
side, it would be simpler then to have it over. Surely, she could
imitate from recollection the glow, the rhapsody, the
self-surrender, she had seen on so many women's faces (on Mrs
Ramsay's, for instance) when on some occasion like this they blazed
up—she could remember the look on Mrs Ramsay's face—into a rapture
of sympathy, of delight in the reward they had, which, though the
reason of it escaped her, evidently conferred on them the most
supreme bliss of which human nature was capable. Here he was,
stopped by her side. She would give him what she could.</p>
