<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
</div>


<p>As she lurched (for she rolled like a ship at sea) and leered
(for her eyes fell on nothing directly, but with a sidelong glance
that deprecated the scorn and anger of the world—she was witless,
she knew it), as she clutched the banisters and hauled herself
upstairs and rolled from room to room, she sang. Rubbing the glass
of the long looking-glass and leering sideways at her swinging
figure a sound issued from her lips—something that had been gay
twenty years before on the stage perhaps, had been hummed and
danced to, but now, coming from the toothless, bonneted,
care-taking woman, was robbed of meaning, was like the voice of
witlessness, humour, persistency itself, trodden down but springing
up again, so that as she lurched, dusting, wiping, she seemed to
say how it was one long sorrow and trouble, how it was getting up
and going to bed again, and bringing things out and putting them
away again. It was not easy or snug this world she had known for
close on seventy years. Bowed down she was with weariness. How
long, she asked, creaking and groaning on her knees under the bed,
dusting the boards, how long shall it endure? but hobbled to her
feet again, pulled herself up, and again with her sidelong leer
which slipped and turned aside even from her own face, and her own
sorrows, stood and gaped in the glass, aimlessly smiling, and began
again the old amble and hobble, taking up mats, putting down china,
looking sideways in the glass, as if, after all, she had her
consolations, as if indeed there twined about her dirge some
incorrigible hope. Visions of joy there must have been at the wash-
tub, say with her children (yet two had been base-born and one had
deserted her), at the public-house, drinking; turning over scraps
in her drawers. Some cleavage of the dark there must have been,
some channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough
issued to twist her face grinning in the glass and make her,
turning to her job again, mumble out the old music hall song. The
mystic, the visionary, walking the beach on a fine night, stirring
a puddle, looking at a stone, asking themselves "What am I,” "What
is this?” had suddenly an answer vouchsafed them: (they could not
say what it was) so that they were warm in the frost and had
comfort in the desert. But Mrs McNab continued to drink and gossip
as before.</p>
