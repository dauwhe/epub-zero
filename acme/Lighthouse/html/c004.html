<p>Indeed, he almost knocked her easel over, coming down upon her
with his hands waving shouting out, "Boldly we rode and well,” but,
mercifully, he turned sharp, and rode off, to die gloriously she
supposed upon the heights of Balaclava. Never was anybody at once
so ridiculous and so alarming. But so long as he kept like that,
waving, shouting, she was safe; he would not stand still and look
at her picture. And that was what Lily Briscoe could not have
endured. Even while she looked at the mass, at the line, at the
colour, at Mrs Ramsay sitting in the window with James, she kept a
feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep up, and
suddenly she should find her picture looked at. But now, with all
her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the
colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she
was aware of someone coming out of the house, coming towards her;
but somehow divined, from the footfall, William Bankes, so that
though her brush quivered, she did not, as she would have done had
it been Mr Tansley, Paul Rayley, Minta Doyle, or practically
anybody else, turn her canvas upon the grass, but let it stand.
William Bankes stood beside her.</p>
<p>They had rooms in the village, and so, walking in, walking out,
parting late on door-mats, had said little things about the soup,
about the children, about one thing and another which made them
allies; so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way
(he was old enough to be her father too, a botanist, a widower,
smelling of soap, very scrupulous and clean) she just stood there.
He just stood there. Her shoes were excellent, he observed. They
allowed the toes their natural expansion. Lodging in the same house
with her, he had noticed too, how orderly she was, up before
breakfast and off to paint, he believed, alone: poor, presumably,
and without the complexion or the allurement of Miss Doyle
certainly, but with a good sense which made her in his eyes
superior to that young lady. Now, for instance, when Ramsay bore
down on them, shouting, gesticulating, Miss Briscoe, he felt
certain, understood.</p>
<p>Some one had blundered.</p>
<p>Mr Ramsay glared at them. He glared at them without seeming to
see them. That did make them both vaguely uncomfortable. Together
they had seen a thing they had not been meant to see. They had
encroached upon a privacy. So, Lily thought, it was probably an
excuse of his for moving, for getting out of earshot, that made Mr
Bankes almost immediately say something about its being chilly and
suggested taking a stroll. She would come, yes. But it was with
difficulty that she took her eyes off her picture.</p>
<p>The jacmanna was bright violet; the wall staring white. She
would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright
violet and the staring white, since she saw them like that,
fashionable though it was, since Mr Paunceforte's visit, to see
everything pale, elegant, semitransparent. Then beneath the colour
there was the shape. She could see it all so clearly, so
commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in
hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment's flight
between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who
often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from
conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a
child. Such she often felt herself—struggling against terrific odds
to maintain her courage; to say: "But this is what I see; this is
what I see,” and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision
to her breast, which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from
her. And it was then too, in that chill and windy way, as she began
to paint, that there forced themselves upon her other things, her
own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for her father
off the Brompton Road, and had much ado to control her impulse to
fling herself (thank Heaven she had always resisted so far) at Mrs
Ramsay's knee and say to her—but what could one say to her? "I'm in
love with you?” No, that was not true. "I'm in love with this all,"
waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children. It was
absurd, it was impossible. So now she laid her brushes neatly in
the box, side by side, and said to William Bankes:</p>
<p>“It suddenly gets cold. The sun seems to give less heat,” she
said, looking about her, for it was bright enough, the grass still
a soft deep green, the house starred in its greenery with purple
passion flowers, and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue.
But something moved, flashed, turned a silver wing in the air. It
was September after all, the middle of September, and past six in
the evening. So off they strolled down the garden in the usual
direction, past the tennis lawn, past the pampas grass, to that
break in the thick hedge, guarded by red hot pokers like brasiers
of clear burning coal, between which the blue waters of the bay
looked bluer than ever.</p>
<p>They came there regularly every evening drawn by some need. It
was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had
grown stagnant on dry land, and gave to their bodies even some sort
of physical relief. First, the pulse of colour flooded the bay with
blue, and the heart expanded with it and the body swam, only the
next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on
the ruffled waves. Then, up behind the great black rock, almost
every evening spurted irregularly, so that one had to watch for it
and it was a delight when it came, a fountain of white water; and
then, while one waited for that, one watched, on the pale
semicircular beach, wave after wave shedding again and again
smoothly, a film of mother of pearl.</p>
<p>They both smiled, standing there. They both felt a common
hilarity, excited by the moving waves; and then by the swift
cutting race of a sailing boat, which, having sliced a curve in the
bay, stopped; shivered; let its sails drop down; and then, with a
natural instinct to complete the picture, after this swift
movement, both of them looked at the dunes far away, and instead of
merriment felt come over them some sadness—because the thing was
completed partly, and partly because distant views seem to outlast
by a million years (Lily thought) the gazer and to be communing
already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest.</p>
<p>Looking at the far sand hills, William Bankes thought of Ramsay:
thought of a road in Westmorland, thought of Ramsay striding along
a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be
his natural air. But this was suddenly interrupted, William Bankes
remembered (and this must refer to some actual incident), by a hen,
straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks,
upon which Ramsay, stopping, pointed his stick and said
"Pretty—pretty,” an odd illumination in to his heart, Bankes had
thought it, which showed his simplicity, his sympathy with humble
things; but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased,
there, on that stretch of road. After that, Ramsay had married.
After that, what with one thing and another, the pulp had gone out
of their friendship. Whose fault it was he could not say, only,
after a time, repetition had taken the place of newness. It was to
repeat that they met. But in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes
he maintained that his affection for Ramsay had in no way
diminished; but there, like the body of a young man laid up in peat
for a century, with the red fresh on his lips, was his friendship,
in its acuteness and reality, laid up across the bay among the
sandhills.</p>
<p>He was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too
in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of
having dried and shrunk—for Ramsay lived in a welter of children,
whereas Bankes was childless and a widower—he was anxious that Lily
Briscoe should not disparage Ramsay (a great man in his own way)
yet should understand how things stood between them. Begun long
years ago, their friendship had petered out on a Westmorland road,
where the hen spread her wings before her chicks; after which
Ramsay had married, and their paths lying different ways, there had
been, certainly for no one's fault, some tendency, when they met,
to repeat.</p>
<p>Yes. That was it. He finished. He turned from the view. And,
turning to walk back the other way, up the drive, Mr Bankes was
alive to things which would not have struck him had not those
sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the
red on its lips laid up in peat—for instance, Cam, the little girl,
Ramsay's youngest daughter. She was picking Sweet Alice on the
bank. She was wild and fierce. She would not "give a flower to the
gentleman” as the nursemaid told her. No! no! no! she would not!
She clenched her fist. She stamped. And Mr Bankes felt aged and
saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his
friendship. He must have dried and shrunk.</p>
<p>The Ramsays were not rich, and it was a wonder how they managed
to contrive it all. Eight children! To feed eight children on
philosophy! Here was another of them, Jasper this time, strolling
past, to have a shot at a bird, he said, nonchalantly, swinging
Lily's hand like a pump-handle as he passed, which caused Mr Bankes
to say, bitterly, how SHE was a favourite. There was education now
to be considered (true, Mrs Ramsay had something of her own
perhaps) let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings
which those "great fellows,” all well grown, angular, ruthless
youngsters, must require. As for being sure which was which, or in
what order they came, that was beyond him. He called them privately
after the Kings and Queens of England; Cam the Wicked, James the
Ruthless, Andrew the Just, Prue the Fair—for Prue would have
beauty, he thought, how could she help it?—and Andrew brains. While
he walked up the drive and Lily Briscoe said yes and no and capped
his comments (for she was in love with them all, in love with this
world) he weighed Ramsay's case, commiserated him, envied him, as
if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation
and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself
definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities. They
gave him something—William Bankes acknowledged that; it would have
been pleasant if Cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered
over his shoulder, as over her father's, to look at a picture of
Vesuviusin eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not
but feel, destroyed something. What would a stranger think now?
What did this Lily Briscoe think? Could one help noticing that
habits grew on him? eccentricities, weaknesses perhaps? It was
astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he
did—but that was too harsh a phrase—could depend so much as he did
upon people's praise.</p>
<p>“Oh, but,” said Lily, "think of his work!”</p>
<p>Whenever she "thought of his work” she always saw clearly before
her a large kitchen table. It was Andrew's doing. She asked him
what his father's books were about. "Subject and object and the
nature of reality,” Andrew had said. And when she said Heavens, she
had no notion what that meant. "Think of a kitchen table then,” he
told her, "when you're not there.”</p>
<p>So now she always saw, when she thought of Mr Ramsay's work, a
scrubbed kitchen table. It lodged now in the fork of a pear tree,
for they had reached the orchard. And with a painful effort of
concentration, she focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed
bark of the tree, or upon its fish-shaped leaves, but upon a
phantom kitchen table, one of those scrubbed board tables, grained
and knotted, whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of
muscular integrity, which stuck there, its four legs in air.
Naturally, if one's days were passed in this seeing of angular
essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo
clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four-legged table (and
it was a mark of the finest minds to do so), naturally one could
not be judged like an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Mr Bankes liked her for bidding him "think of his work.” He had
thought of it, often and often. Times without number, he had said,
"Ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are
forty.” He had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one
little book when he was only five and twenty; what came after was
more or less amplification, repetition. But the number of men who
make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small,
he said, pausing by the pear tree, well brushed, scrupulously
exact, exquisitely judicial. Suddenly, as if the movement of his
hand had released it, the load of her accumulated impressions of
him tilted up, and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she
felt about him. That was one sensation. Then up rose in a fume the
essence of his being. That was another. She felt herself transfixed
by the intensity of her perception; it was his severity; his
goodness. I respect you (she addressed silently him in person) in
every atom; you are not vain; you are entirely impersonal; you are
finer than Mr Ramsay; you are the finest human being that I know;
you have neither wife nor child (without any sexual feeling, she
longed to cherish that loneliness), you live for science
(involuntarily, sections of potatoes rose before her eyes); praise
would be an insult to you; generous, pure-hearted, heroic man! But
simultaneously, she remembered how he had brought a valet all the
way up here; objected to dogs on chairs; would prose for hours
(until Mr Ramsay slammed out of the room) about salt in vegetables
and the iniquity of English cooks.</p>
<p>How then did it work out, all this? How did one judge people,
think of them? How did one add up this and that and conclude that
it was liking one felt or disliking? And to those words, what
meaning attached, after all? Standing now, apparently transfixed,
by the pear tree, impressions poured in upon her of those two men,
and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks
too quickly to be taken down by one's pencil, and the voice was her
own voice saying without prompting undeniable, everlasting,
contradictory things, so that even the fissures and humps on the
bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity.
You have greatness, she continued, but Mr Ramsay has none of it. He
is petty, selfish, vain, egotistical; he is spoilt; he is a tyrant;
he wears Mrs Ramsay to death; but he has what you (she addressed Mr
Bankes) have not; a fiery unworldliness; he knows nothing about
trifles; he loves dogs and his children. He has eight. Mr Bankes
has none. Did he not come down in two coats the other night and let
Mrs Ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin? All of this danced
up and down, like a company of gnats, each separate but all
marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net—danced up and
down in Lily's mind, in and about the branches of the pear tree,
where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table, symbol of
her profound respect for Mr Ramsay's mind, until her thought which
had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity; she
felt released; a shot went off close at hand, and there came,
flying from its fragments, frightened, effusive, tumultuous, a
flock of starlings.</p>
<p>“Jasper!” said Mr Bankes. They turned the way the starlings
flew, over the terrace. Following the scatter of swift-flying birds
in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight
into Mr Ramsay, who boomed tragically at them, "Some one had
blundered!”</p>
<p>His eyes, glazed with emotion, defiant with tragic intensity,
met theirs for a second, and trembled on the verge of recognition;
but then, raising his hand, half-way to his face as if to avert, to
brush off, in an agony of peevish shame, their normal gaze, as if
he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be
inevitable, as if he impressed upon them his own child-like
resentment of interruption, yet even in the moment of discovery was
not to be routed utterly, but was determined to hold fast to
something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which
he was ashamed, but in which he revelled—he turned abruptly,
slammed his private door on them; and, Lily Briscoe and Mr Bankes,
looking uneasily up into the sky, observed that the flock of
starlings which Jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the
tops of the elm trees.</p>
