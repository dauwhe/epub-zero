<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<p>He said nothing. He took opium. The children said he had stained
his beard yellow with it. Perhaps. What was obvious to her was that
the poor man was unhappy, came to them every year as an escape; and
yet every year she felt the same thing; he did not trust her. She
said, "I am going to the town. Shall I get you stamps, paper,
tobacco?” and she felt him wince. He did not trust her. It was his
wife's doing. She remembered that iniquity of his wife's towards
him, which had made her turn to steel and adamant there, in the
horrible little room in St John's Wood, when with her own eyes she
had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house. He was
unkempt; he dropped things on his coat; he had the tiresomeness of
an old man with nothing in the world to do; and she turned him out
of the room. She said, in her odious way, "Now, Mrs Ramsay and I
want to have a little talk together,” and Mrs Ramsay could see, as
if before her eyes, the innumerable miseries of his life. Had he
money enough to buy tobacco? Did he have to ask her for it? half a
crown? eighteenpence? Oh, she could not bear to think of the little
indignities she made him suffer. And always now (why, she could not
guess, except that it came probably from that woman somehow) he
shrank from her. He never told her anything. But what more could
she have done? There was a sunny room given up to him. The children
were good to him. Never did she show a sign of not wanting him. She
went out of her way indeed to be friendly. Do you want stamps, do
you want tobacco? Here's a book you might like and so on. And after
all—after all (here insensibly she drew herself together,
physically, the sense of her own beauty becoming, as it did so
seldom, present to her) after all, she had not generally any
difficulty in making people like her; for instance, George Manning;
Mr Wallace; famous as they were, they would come to her of an
evening, quietly, and talk alone over her fire. She bore about with
her, she could not help knowing it, the torch of her beauty; she
carried it erect into any room that she entered; and after all,
veil it as she might, and shrink from the monotony of bearing that
it imposed on her, her beauty was apparent. She had been admired.
She had been loved. She had entered rooms where mourners sat. Tears
had flown in her presence. Men, and women too, letting go to the
multiplicity of things, had allowed themselves with her the relief
of simplicity. It injured her that he should shrink. It hurt her.
And yet not cleanly, not rightly. That was what she minded, coming
as it did on top of her discontent with her husband; the sense she
had now when Mr Carmichael shuffled past, just nodding to her
question, with a book beneath his arm, in his yellow slippers, that
she was suspected; and that all this desire of hers to give, to
help, was vanity. For her own self-satisfaction was it that she
wished so instinctively to help, to give, that people might say of
her, "O Mrs Ramsay! dear Mrs Ramsay… Mrs Ramsay, of course!” and
need her and send for her and admire her? Was it not secretly this
that she wanted, and therefore when Mr Carmichael shrank away from
her, as he did at this moment, making off to some corner where he
did acrostics endlessly, she did not feel merely snubbed back in
her instinct, but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her,
and of human relations, how flawed they are, how despicable, how
self-seeking, at their best. Shabby and worn out, and not
presumably (her cheeks were hollow, her hair was white) any longer
a sight that filled the eyes with joy, she had better devote her
mind to the story of the Fisherman and his Wife and so pacify that
bundle of sensitiveness (none of her children was as sensitive as
he was), her son James.</p>
<p>“The man's heart grew heavy,” she read aloud, "and he would not
go. He said to himself, 'It is not right,' and yet he went. And
when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark blue,
and grey and thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but it was
still quiet. And he stood there and said—”</p>
<p>Mrs Ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen
that moment to stop. Why had he not gone as he said to watch the
children playing cricket? But he did not speak; he looked; he
nodded; he approved; he went on. He slipped, seeing before him that
hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause, signified
some conclusion, seeing his wife and child, seeing again the urns
with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated
processes of thought, and bore, written up among their leaves, as
if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the
rush of reading—he slipped, seeing all this, smoothly into
speculation suggested by an article in THE TIMES about the number
of Americans who visit Shakespeare's house every year. If
Shakespeare had never existed, he asked, would the world have
differed much from what it is today? Does the progress of
civilization depend upon great men? Is the lot of the average human
being better now than in the time of the Pharaohs? Is the lot of
the average human being, however, he asked himself, the criterion
by which we judge the measure of civilization? Possibly not.
Possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class.
The liftman in the Tube is an eternal necessity. The thought was
distasteful to him. He tossed his head. To avoid it, he would find
some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts. He would argue
that the world exists for the average human being; that the arts
are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life; they do
not express it. Nor is Shakespeare necessary to it. Not knowing
precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage Shakespeare and
come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of
the lift, he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge. All this would
have to be dished up for the young men at Cardiff next month, he
thought; here, on his terrace, he was merely foraging and
picnicking (he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly)
like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses, or
stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the
lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood. It was all
familiar; this turning, that stile, that cut across the fields.
Hours he would spend thus, with his pipe, of an evening, thinking
up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons,
which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there,
the life of this statesman here, with poems and with anecdotes,
with figures too, this thinker, that soldier; all very brisk and
clear; but at length the lane, the field, the common, the fruitful
nut-tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of
the road where he dismounted always, tied his horse to a tree, and
proceeded on foot alone. He reached the edge of the lawn and looked
out on the bay beneath.</p>
<p>It was his fate, his peculiarity, whether he wished it or not,
to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating
away, and there to stand, like a desolate sea-bird, alone. It was
his power, his gift, suddenly to shed all superfluities, to shrink
and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer, even
physically, yet lost none of his intensity of mind, and so to stand
on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance, how we know
nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on—that was his
fate, his gift. But having thrown away, when he dismounted, all
gestures and fripperies, all trophies of nuts and roses, and shrunk
so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him,
kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom
and luxuriated in no vision, and it was in this guise that he
inspired in William Bankes (intermittently) and in Charles Tansley
(obsequiously)and in his wife now, when she looked up and saw him
standing at the edge of the lawn, profoundly, reverence, and pity,
and gratitude too, as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon
which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry
boat-loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon
itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone.</p>
<p>“But the father of eight children has no choice.” Muttering half
aloud, so he broke off, turned, sighed, raised his eyes, sought the
figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy, filled his
pipe. He turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate
and the sea eating the ground we stand on, which, had he been able
to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something; and found
consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme
just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over,
to deprecate it, as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was
for an honest man the most despicable of crimes. It was true; he
was for the most part happy; he had his wife; he had his children;
he had promised in six weeks' time to talk "some nonsense” to the
young men of Cardiff about Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and the causes of
the French Revolution. But this and his pleasure in it, his glory
in the phrases he made, in the ardour of youth, in his wife's
beauty, in the tributes that reached him from Swansea, Cardiff,
Exeter, Southampton, Kidderminster, Oxford, Cambridge—all had to be
deprecated and concealed under the phrase "talking nonsense,"
because, in effect, he had not done the thing he might have done.
It was a disguise; it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own
feelings, who could not say, This is what I like—this is what I am;
and rather pitiable and distasteful to William Bankes and Lily
Briscoe, who wondered why such concealments should be necessary;
why he needed always praise; why so brave a man in thought should
be so timid in life; how strangely he was venerable and laughable
at one and the same time.</p>
<p>Teaching and preaching is beyond human power, Lily suspected.
(She was putting away her things.) If you are exalted you must
somehow come a cropper. Mrs Ramsay gave him what he asked too
easily. Then the change must be so upsetting, Lily said. He comes
in from his books and finds us all playing games and talking
nonsense. Imagine what a change from the things he thinks about,
she said.</p>
<p>He was bearing down upon them. Now he stopped dead and stood
looking in silence at the sea. Now he had turned away again.</p>
