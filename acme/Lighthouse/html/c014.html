<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<p>(Certainly, Nancy had gone with them, since Minta Doyle had
asked it with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as Nancy made
off, after lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family
life. She supposed she must go then. She did not want to go. She
did not want to be drawn into it all. For as they walked along the
road to the cliff Minta kept on taking her hand. Then she would let
it go. Then she would take it again. What was it she wanted? Nancy
asked herself. There was something, of course, that people wanted;
for when Minta took her hand and held it, Nancy, reluctantly, saw
the whole world spread out beneath her, as if it were
Constantinople seen through a mist, and then, however heavy-eyed
one might be, one must needs ask, "Is that Santa Sofia?” "Is that
the Golden Horn?” So Nancy asked, when Minta took her hand. "What
is it that she wants? Is it that?” And what was that? Here and
there emerged from the mist (as Nancy looked down upon life spread
beneath her) a pinnacle, a dome; prominent things, without names.
But when Minta dropped her hand, as she did when they ran down the
hillside, all that, the dome, the pinnacle, whatever it was that
had protruded through the mist, sank down into it and disappeared.
Minta, Andrew observed, was rather a good walker. She wore more
sensible clothes that most women. She wore very short skirts and
black knickerbockers. She would jump straight into a stream and
flounder across. He liked her rashness, but he saw that it would
not do—she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these
days. She seemed to be afraid of nothing—except bulls. At the mere
sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly
screaming, which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course. But
she did not mind owning up to it in the least; one must admit that.
She knew she was an awful coward about bulls, she said. She thought
she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby.
She didn't seem to mind what she said or did. Suddenly now she
pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song
about</p>
<p>Damn your eyes, damn your eyes.</p>
<p>They all had to join in and sing the chorus, and shout out
together:</p>
<p>Damn your eyes, damn your eyes,</p>
<p>but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all
the good hunting-grounds before they got on to the beach.</p>
<p>“Fatal,” Paul agreed, springing up, and as they went slithering
down, he kept quoting the guide-book about "these islands being
justly celebrated for their park-like prospects and the extent and
variety of their marine curiosities.” But it would not do
altogether, this shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt,
picking his way down the cliff, this clapping him on the back, and
calling him "old fellow” and all that; it would not altogether do.
It was the worst of taking women on walks. Once on the beach they
separated, he going out on to the Pope's Nose, taking his shoes
off, and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look
after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her
own pools and let that couple look after themselves. She crouched
low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were
stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock. Brooding, she
changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and
whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her
hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like
God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and
then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down. Out
on the pale criss-crossed sand, high-stepping, fringed, gauntleted,
stalked some fantastic leviathan (she was still enlarging the
pool), and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side. And
then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest
on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the
smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon, she became with all
that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing,
hypnotised, and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess
(the pool had diminished again) flowering within it made her feel
that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the
intensity of feelings which reduced her own body, her own life, and
the lives of all the people in the world, for ever, to nothingness.
So listening to the waves, crouching over the pool, she
brooded.</p>
<p>And Andrew shouted that the sea was coming in, so she leapt
splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the
beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for
rapid movement right behind a rock and there—oh, heavens! in each
other's arms, were Paul and Minta kissing probably. She was
outraged, indignant. She and Andrew put on their shoes and
stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it. Indeed
they were rather sharp with each other. She might have called him
when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was, Andrew grumbled.
However, they both felt, it's not our fault. They had not wanted
this horrid nuisance to happen. All the same it irritated Andrew
that Nancy should be a woman, and Nancy that Andrew should be a
man, and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather
tight.</p>
<p>It was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the
cliff again that Minta cried out that she had lost her
grandmother's brooch— her grandmother's brooch, the sole ornament
she possessed—a weeping willow, it was (they must remember it) set
in pearls. They must have seen it, she said, with the tears running
down her cheeks, the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her
cap with till the last day of her life. Now she had lost it. She
would rather have lost anything than that! She would go back and
look for it. They all went back. They poked and peered and looked.
They kept their heads very low, and said things shortly and
gruffly. Paul Rayley searched like a madman all about the rock
where they had been sitting. All this pother about a brooch really
didn't do at all, Andrew thought, as Paul told him to make a
"thorough search between this point and that.” The tide was coming
in fast. The sea would cover the place where they had sat in a
minute. There was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now.
"We shall be cut off!” Minta shrieked, suddenly terrified. As if
there were any danger of that! It was the same as the bulls all
over again—she had no control over her emotions, Andrew thought.
Women hadn't. The wretched Paul had to pacify her. The men (Andrew
and Paul at once became manly, and different from usual) took
counsel briefly and decided that they would plant Rayley's stick
where they had sat and come back at low tide again. There was
nothing more that could be done now. If the brooch was there, it
would still be there in the morning, they assured her, but Minta
still sobbed, all the way up to the top of the cliff. It was her
grandmother's brooch; she would rather have lost anything but that,
and yet Nancy felt, it might be true that she minded losing her
brooch, but she wasn't crying only for that. She was crying for
something else. We might all sit down and cry, she felt. But she
did not know what for.</p>
<p>They drew ahead together, Paul and Minta, and he comforted her,
and said how famous he was for finding things. Once when he was a
little boy he had found a gold watch. He would get up at daybreak
and he was positive he would find it. It seemed to him that it
would be almost dark, and he would be alone on the beach, and
somehow it would be rather dangerous. He began telling her,
however, that he would certainly find it, and she said that she
would not hear of his getting up at dawn: it was lost: she knew
that: she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon.
And secretly he resolved that he would not tell her, but he would
slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he
could not find it he would go to Edinburgh and buy her another,
just like it but more beautiful. He would prove what he could do.
And as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town
beneath them, the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like
things that were going to happen to him—his marriage, his children,
his house; and again he thought, as they came out on to the high
road, which was shaded with high bushes, how they would retreat
into solitude together, and walk on and on, he always leading her,
and she pressing close to his side (as she did now). As they turned
by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had
been through, and he must tell some one—Mrs Ramsay of course, for
it took his breath away to think what he had been and done. It had
been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked Minta
to marry him. He would go straight to Mrs Ramsay, because he felt
somehow that she was the person who had made him do it. She had
made him think he could do anything. Nobody else took him
seriously. But she made him believe that he could do whatever he
wanted. He had felt her eyes on him all day today, following him
about (though she never said a word) as if she were saying, "Yes,
you can do it. I believe in you. I expect it of you.” She had made
him feel all that, and directly they got back (he looked for the
lights of the house above the bay) he would go to her and say,
"I've done it, Mrs Ramsay; thanks to you.” And so turning into the
lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the
upper windows. They must be awfully late then. People were getting
ready for dinner. The house was all lit up, and the lights after
the darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself,
childishly, as he walked up the drive, Lights, lights, lights, and
repeated in a dazed way, Lights, lights, lights, as they came into
the house staring about him with his face quite stiff. But, good
heavens, he said to himself, putting his hand to his tie, I must
not make a fool of myself.)</p>
