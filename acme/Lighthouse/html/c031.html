<p>What does it mean then, what can it all mean? Lily Briscoe asked
herself, wondering whether, since she had been left alone, it
behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or
wait here. What does it mean?—a catchword that was, caught up from
some book, fitting her thought loosely, for she could not, this
first morning with the Ramsays, contract her feelings, could only
make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until
these vapours had shrunk. For really, what did she feel, come back
after all these years and Mrs Ramsay dead? Nothing, nothing—nothing
that she could express at all.</p>
<p>She had come late last night when it was all mysterious, dark.
Now she was awake, at her old place at the breakfast table, but
alone. It was very early too, not yet eight. There was this
expedition—they were going to the Lighthouse, Mr Ramsay, Cam, and
James. They should have gone already—they had to catch the tide or
something. And Cam was not ready and James was not ready and Nancy
had forgotten to order the sandwiches and Mr Ramsay had lost his
temper and banged out of the room.</p>
<p>“What's the use of going now?” he had stormed.</p>
<p>Nancy had vanished. There he was, marching up and down the
terrace in a rage. One seemed to hear doors slamming and voices
calling all over the house. Now Nancy burst in, and asked, looking
round the room, in a queer half dazed, half desperate way, "What
does one send to the Lighthouse?” as if she were forcing herself to
do what she despaired of ever being able to do.</p>
<p>What does one send to the Lighthouse indeed! At any other time
Lily could have suggested reasonably tea, tobacco, newspapers. But
this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a
question like Nancy's—What does one send to the Lighthouse?—opened
doors in one's mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and
made one keep asking, in a stupefied gape, What does one send? What
does one do? Why is one sitting here, after all?</p>
<p>Sitting alone (for Nancy went out again) among the clean cups at
the long table, she felt cut off from other people, and able only
to go on watching, asking, wondering. The house, the place, the
morning, all seemed strangers to her. She had no attachment here,
she felt, no relations with it, anything might happen, and whatever
did happen, a step outside, a voice calling ("It's not in the
cupboard; it's on the landing,” some one cried), was a question, as
if the link that usually bound things together had been cut, and
they floated up here, down there, off, anyhow. How aimless it was,,
how chaotic, how unreal it was, she thought, looking at her empty
coffee cup. Mrs Ramsay dead; Andrew killed; Prue dead too—repeat it
as she might, it roused no feeling in her. And we all get together
in a house like this on a morning like this, she said, looking out
of the window. It was a beautiful still day.</p>
