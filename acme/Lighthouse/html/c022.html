<p>So with the lamps all put out, the moon sunk, and a thin rain
drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began.
Nothing, it seemed, could survive the flood, the profusion of
darkness which, creeping in at keyholes and crevices, stole round
window blinds, came into bedrooms, swallowed up here a jug and
basin, there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp
edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers. Not only was furniture
confounded; there was scarcely anything left of body or mind by
which one could say, "This is he” or "This is she.” Sometimes a
hand was raised as if to clutch something or ward off something, or
somebody groaned, or somebody laughed aloud as if sharing a joke
with nothingness.</p>
<p>Nothing stirred in the drawing-room or in the dining-room or on
the staircase. Only through the rusty hinges and swollen
sea-moistened woodwork certain airs, detached from the body of the
wind (the house was ramshackle after all) crept round corners and
ventured indoors. Almost one might imagine them, as they entered
the drawing-room questioning and wondering, toying with the flap of
hanging wall-paper, asking, would it hang much longer, when would
it fall? Then smoothly brushing the walls, they passed on musingly
as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wall-paper whether
they would fade, and questioning (gently, for there was time at
their disposal) the torn letters in the wastepaper basket, the
flowers, the books, all of which were now open to them and asking,
Were they allies? Were they enemies? How long would they
endure?</p>
<p>So some random light directing them with its pale footfall upon
stair and mat, from some uncovered star, or wandering ship, or the
Lighthouse even, with its pale footfall upon stair and mat, the
little airs mounted the staircase and nosed round bedroom doors.
But here surely, they must cease. Whatever else may perish and
disappear, what lies here is steadfast. Here one might say to those
sliding lights, those fumbling airs that breathe and bend over the
bed itself, here you can neither touch nor destroy. Upon which,
wearily, ghostlily, as if they had feather-light fingers and the
light persistency of feathers, they would look, once, on the shut
eyes, and the loosely clasping fingers, and fold their garments
wearily and disappear. And so, nosing, rubbing, they went to the
window on the staircase, to the servants' bedrooms, to the boxes in
the attics; descending, blanched the apples on the dining-room
table, fumbled the petals of roses, tried the picture on the easel,
brushed the mat and blew a little sand along the floor. At length,
desisting, all ceased together, gathered together, all sighed
together; all together gave off an aimless gust of lamentation to
which some door in the kitchen replied; swung wide; admitted
nothing; and slammed to.</p>

candle. It was past midnight.]</p>
