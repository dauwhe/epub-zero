<p>[The sea without a stain on it, thought Lily Briscoe, still
standing and looking out over the bay. The sea stretched like silk
across the bay. Distance had an extraordinary power; they had been
swallowed up in it, she felt, they were gone for ever, they had
become part of the nature of things. It was so calm; it was so
quiet. The steamer itself had vanished, but the great scroll of
smoke still hung in the air and drooped like a flag mournfully in
valediction.]</p>
